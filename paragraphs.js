"Horns Doubling the Vocal Melody with the Strings establishing the harmony underneath sounds amazing. I can definitely hear the Impressionist influence, but it has an intensity unlike Debussy or Ravel which I can’t really describe. I’m a big fan of this piece.",
"A Romanticist Piece for sure given the almost over the top tempos, ranges, harmonies, and themes. At times I felt it was a bit too much, but I enjoyed the piece for the most part. I really enjoyed the opening theme in the viola from the second movement, and the ending of the fourth movement was VERY exciting.",
"I liked this series of 11 short pieces for piaNumber It was interesting to see how he took a single set of notes and turned it into something interesting. Such was the case with the first piece, which consisted solely of the note A. He was really good at creating a certain level of interest from something which is seemingly uninteresting. I noticed in a few of the pieces, such as the second, he used non- traditional key signatures. I also really enjoyed the sixth piece. His use of stretto in the staccato main theme gave it a very carefree and joyful aesthetic, and there is one point where he uses a perfect fifth low in the range of the piano that is really powerful. I also thought the seventh piece and its use of a left hand bassline completely independent of the right hand melody was very unique and effective. I really liked the type of sound it brought to the table, especially when the melody went into two part counterpoint. The seventh piece also had a really cool 7-8 groove that reminded me a lot of the syncopation in Enchanted Spaces by Samuel R. Hazo.",
"The first movement opens canonically with some haunting yet beautiful harmonies. I wasn’t a huge fan of the section where the violin played over the other instruments droning, but I did like the textural change from the opening. The very fast second movement actually gave me chills of fear not only from a performance standpoint but also from an emotional standpoint. Very exhilarating! I loved the section with the cello and viola playing the triplet bassline doubled in octaves under the violins playing the melody doubled two octaves apart. I like the third movement waltz variation on that melody as well. The recapitulation of the opening theme of the first movement in the fifth movement was refreshing.",
"I wasn’t a huge fan of the first movement. The opening theme is very chromatic and places all of the instruments high in their register. This becomes more pronounced as the movement progresses, leading to a very shrill and strained sound. This effect can be useful in the right setting, such as in the opening bassoon solo of  The Rite of Spring, but here I found it out of place. Maybe that was the effect he was going for. He did a really cool effect in the middle of the second movement where the upper Strings holding out some harmony had ffp placed in certain measures. It gave the section an almost injured sound, like someone gasping hopelessly for air. The following section had pizzicato strings emphasizing these gasps, and it gave me chills. Very unsettling. After that, the cello picked up a walking 4’s pattern, and the upper strings imitated an almost swing feel with syncopated and triplet rhythms. I really liked this section, as it was a nice break from the preceding intensity. I liked how he had cello doubling violin I in octaves while violin II and viola filled in the harmony in the middle. The ending crescendo into a very high, unresolved note was incredibly unsettling. Overall didn’t hate this piece, but I wouldn’t listen to it at night again or if I wanted to feel happy afterwards.",
"Ah I love this piece. I’ve heard it before, but didn’t know it by name. This is a truly beautiful piece of music. A lot of its beauty lies in its melodic construction, as well as his treatment of the underlying harmony. The melody broken down to its most basic form is a descending E minor scale starting on the 5th scale degree (B). For the entirety of the piece, this melody is constantly striving to find resolution at the final tonic E; however, Chopin does not give us this resolution until the very end as a way to incite emotional stress. He built an expectation, and continues to deny the listener that which they subconsciously desire- resolution. The first time he is about to reach the E, he has a little run on the F which brings us back up to the top of the melody, the B. The second time he does bring us back down to the E, but lands us instead on a C major chord instead of an E minor chord, again breaking expectation. In the final few bars, he keeps landing on that E, yet refuses to do so in the context of an E minor chord until the very last bar. The entire piece is dedicated to building tension and breaking expectations until the very last measure. In doing this, Chopin builds an incredible amount of tension and truly creates an incredible amount of emotional stress for the listener.",
"I had to write a tad about this one. Short, simple, but incredibly sweet. It reminded me a lot of Giacchinos score from Up in a lot of ways. I think the biggest thing that did it for me was the lurch to the VI7 towards the end. Really just beautiful, and definitely underrated in my mind.",
"A much quicker piece with a compound melody in the right hand. One part I really liked with when he added in the Picardy third on the tonic F# minor chord a bit towards the end of the piece, before moving away again and finally ending on an F# minor chord. Normally the Picardy third makes its appearance largely at the end of the piece, like in a lot of Bach’s preludes and Fugues. I think that having it halfway through the piece is a really cool and unexpected effect. The only other place I explicitly recall seeing this is in Happy Together by the Turtles. It might occur much more often, but in any case, I thought it was worth documenting. He also ends it with a lean on a F#m (maj7). I really liked that.",
"Another piece I have heard before but was unable to recognize by name. This piece has a strong vertical component, yet there is still a horizontal melody present. It is very simple, a lot like the one from his Prelude Opus  28 Number 4 from above, and I think a large part of what gives the melody its interest is the harmonic context. This melody frequently reaches a place of relative harmonic stasis, but it appears to me that where this stasis lies is constantly changing. The tonal centers seem to shift around every measure. This is a technique of Chopin’s that I have seen time and time again in listening to his Opus  28 Preludes, but here it is taken to an extreme I have yet to see. I think the character this gives the piece is one of intensity and drive, which is surprising to me given the nebulous nature of what he is doing. I think the effect used properly like it is here could be incredibly useful. He is building intensity harmonically, despite the fact that the melody is essentially the same one measure motif repeated in sequence throughout the entire piece.",
"Heard about this piece through the YouTuber David Bruce. He talked about its almost spiral form, so I thought I would check it out. Sibelius was a late Romantic Finnish Composer who helped Finland develop a national musical identity as it struggled to gain independence from Russia. The piece, premiered in 1915, is in three movements, and seems to favor lighter textures and orchestrations. The first movement opens up with a beautiful chorale played by French Horns. At one point he doubles bassoon and clarinet at the unison, which I really liked. I very smooth sound. The whole first movement felt very upbeat and lovely. The whole second movement was very light and playful, yet also delicate. Some of the upper wind stuff reminded me a lot of Venus by Gustav Holst. Really very pretty. A noticed he had a tendency to follow very pizzicato sections with legato sections. This seemed to give the whole movement an ebb and flow much like what one sees in Impressionistic music, and I quite liked it. The ending was so incredibly light and lovely, leading out with an oboe solo. Very nice way to wrap up the movement, I would say. The very opening of the final movement sounded slightly Copeland- esque. He was a nationalistic composer so it would make a bit of sense.  It seems he brings back a variation of the french horn chorale from the first movement here and there, which would provide support for the spiral form analysis. I also here the horns playing a line that sounds almost exactly like one of the pieces from Philip Glass’ Glassworks. I think this may be the bit David Bruce mentioned was the exact same played forwards and backwards. Not a retrograde, but a mirror image of itself. Parts of the final movement gave me chills, but I really wasn’t a huge fan of the ending. Given how the rest of the movement was going, I was kinda hoping for a more florid ending rather than some dominant tonic resolution separated by grand pauses. Overall not a bad piece. I am definitely interested in listening to some more Sibelius now.",
"Dr. Coleman gave us a lecture on Sophia at Composition forum this week. She is a composer hailing from the former soviet union, and for her, music was a means of escape from that climate. She used the Fibonacci sequence and Golden Ratio heavily in her music, using it to determine forms, themes, and climaxes. Stimmen Verstummen is a 12 movement symphony depicting the apocalypse, and the form of the entire piece is determined entirely by the Fibonacci Sequence (or some derivation thereof) and the Golden Ratio. The movements alter Earthly and Eternal, with the eternal movements becoming shorter and shorter as the Earthly descends into chaos. She makes extensive use of extended techniques and polytonality to create a very chaotic sound. Another interesting aspect of the piece is the ninth movement, as it is labeled as a Conductor’s Cadenza. The conductor is given very specific instructions regarding hand movements to make during an approximately minute long period of near silence. I’m not completely sold on this tactic, but it is unique nonetheless. The piece certainly has its moments of beauty, such as the D major chord played by the organ in a few of the Eternal movements, but from the time the brass play a Db major chord on top of that as transition into the Earthly, I feel very unsettled!",
"I really enjoyed Lili’s Vieille prière bouddhique, so I figured I would give this piece a try. Right away I notice her style. It is very distinct harmonically, melodically, and texturally. Impressionistic, but still a bit romantic at the same time. Almost like Sibelius in that way, but leaning more towards impressionism. I think that the solo tenor voice sounds very good with the orchestra, especially in its upper register. A very beautiful sound, yet the lower register provides a very dark sound as well. I liked the contrast between a lot of the sections. Some of them felt almost gooey and passionate and beautiful, but some were driving and intense and dark. It truly attests to Lili’s musical senses and craft.",
"I liked the opening marimba introduction harkening to the African music Tradition. This was a clever choice on the end of Lebo M., and it may have to do with his South African descent. There are still synths and strings accentuating this, giving it a more modern sound, which helps with the commercial appeal. I liked how there was a featured singer in the piece, with an ensemble singing rhythmic pads of sometimes a different language. This is like what Sideways talked about in his discussion of the function of language in Moana. Mixing the language of the source material and the target audience invites those people into the other culture while also giving the music a more authentic sound. I was also a huge fan of the electric bass added in there as well. It played a really important role throughout the song, and it gave the piece an almost Peter Gabriel sound. Overall a really beautiful piece.",
"So this was an interesting piece in that it seemed to blend two different musical genres from two different musical time periods like a musical anachronism. The organ opening suggested a very post Renaissance Catholic Church tradition, but the synths, guitars, and electric bass sounded almost 70s punk rock. What I liked about was that it totally worked. Kinda like He Lives in You (Reprise), mixing the familiar with the source material takes the edge off what would be pure source material and injects something the target audience can relate to. And the musical came out in 1976, so the 70’s punk rock sounds aligns with what would have been, at the time, the target audience. It also turns out that Pink Floyd almost sued Webber because the opening organ riff is just like the riff from their song Echoes, which again only supports my theory. All in all a very cool sound that could definitely grow on me.",
"We sang this piece in chorus a few years back, and hearing it performed in a non- choir setting is interesting. It seems that the song is being sung by different characters with different goals, but the commonality they have is the desire to attempt those goals immediately (One Day More). This is reflected in the counterpoint of the piece. We see each character sing their intentions separately, but then come together at the same time in counterpoint. The voices are independent of one another, yet like their goals, share a common harmonic function. It’s word painting whats happening musically, a lot like what happens in Hallelujah by Leonard Cohen when he says, It goes like this, the 4th the 5th. as the piece progresses through the 4th and 5th diatonic chords. I also just like the harmonies in general. I don’t know exactly what’s happening, but it sounds very longing yet optimistic. Very cool piece with a neat little hidden device for the music theorists.",
"A song essentially about a girl named Veronica surrendering her cares about other peoples’ opinions of her due to an impending doom and sneaking into a guy named J.D’s room to have sex with him. The piece is definitely in a rock style with common rock band instrumentation (drum set, electric bass, electric guitar, some synths, as well as some horns and strings). The counterpoint between Veronica and J.D. acts a lot like the conversation between them, with each expressing their feelings and intentions. Not much more to say about this piece other than it sounds a little bit like a Chicago rock piece at times. I thought the lyrics were a little silly, but that’s the effect they were going for. Not bad, but I think some context would do this piece better justice than me just listening to it without having seen the show. Still not a bad piece though, as I currently find myself relistening to it for the third time.",
"Again, obviously a rock style based on the instrumentation and overall aesthetic of the sound, but it had a bit more heavy of a lean on the strings. I really really liked the main melody. Super powerful and just really pretty in general. Its in A major, but the melody definitely tonicizes E major (using a G# major chromatic mediant chord to modulate) from the get go before moving back into A major. As such, it emphasizes the minor v chord borrowed from the parallel minor key of E major (which also happens to be the ii in A major, making the transition back into that key pretty seamless). This is what happens in Happy Together by The Turtles. Its almost going backwards from what one should do (borrowing the major V from the parallel major key to get the leading tone). I’m not sure how I would describe the aesthetic this gives both pieces, but I really like it either way. I’ve always been a fan of the minor v anyways. It takes the edge off a major V resolving to minor or major i/I. The piece has a lot of shifting around, much like their emotional states, and I think it comes across really well.",
"This piece is really effective in establishing the tone of the musical. It opens with a High School Junior, Jeremy, waiting for his porn to load, and goes on to outline the basic characters and conflicts of the show. The show is essentially about Jeremy taking a pill called SQUIP, which is a supercomputer in his brain that will instruct him how to be popular, and having to learn how to cope with it and make his own decisions. The electronic synth sound of this piece is almost foreshadowing of this electronic aspect of the plot. Also based on what I’ve read without having seen the show, some future pieces in the musical are also referenced within this song. This would account for a lot of the textural and stylistic changes within the piece. This also leads me to believe that this piece was composed later in the composition of the musical. Either that or the other pieces it referenced were really well planned out before being notated. This approach is actually pretty common, for example, the opening scene of It (2017) with Georgie was filmed last. It is a defining moment in the film, so Andy Muschietti wanted to make sure that Bill Skarsgård had time to develop Pennywise’s character. Overall I wasn’t a huge fan of the piece, but hearing the music in the show might change that opinion.",
"This piece serves as the audience’s first introduction to the Squip. Again, as in More Than Survive, the electronic synths and vocal effects serve to reflect this electronic component. There is also a textural change the time the Squip is first mentioned. This either implies the damage the Squip could inflict or the mysterious nature of it. I liked this piece more than the last one. The textural changes were cool, and I noticed that the phrase lengths were changing pretty frequently, which kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.",
"Syrinx is a piece which was composed in 1913 for Solo Flute, and it is widely considered to be an indispensable part of Solo Flute repertoire. It opens with a three note motif in sequence at the whole step, a four note descending scale, and then a variation on the opening three note motif. The rest of the piece is a development of these opening two measures. The piece makes excellent use of the range of the flute, and his softer dynamics in the lower end of the flutes range and louder dynamics in the upper register indicate an idiomatic knowledge of the instrument. The piece makes use of trills occasionally, but aside from that does not use any other extended techniques. Its also worth mentioning that the final two bars are almost identical to the opening flute solo from his Prelude a laprés midi dune faune. It is a beautiful piece of music that I would certainly listen to again.",
"This is a beautiful piece for solo flute. It was composed in  1936 for Georges Barrère’s Platinum Flute, with the density of platinum being close to Twenty One point Five grams per cubic centimeter. This piece reminds me very much of Syrinx by Debussy, another solo Flute piece. Although the two pieces were composed 23 years apart, both composers were of French descent, which might explain some of the similarities. The piece starts out by introducing a three note motif which outlines a tritone. It seems that the rest of the piece is simply development of this motif in some fashion. This is much the same as what Debussy did in Syrinx. The piece does an incredible job of showcasing the range of the instrument, first starting out in its lowest register and then moving at times into the upper extremes of its range. The piece has a little bit of tremolo, and also features the occasional pizzicato flute. I really liked this sound, although due to its dynamic characteristics, I imagine it would only be useful in settings with very light instrumentation or none at all. Overall I think there is something very unique about being able to create a captivating piece on solo flute.",
"Luciano Berio was an Italian composer active in the 20th century and known for his experimental work. His Sequenzas are 14 works for various solo instruments which call for extended techniques and one heck of a performer. His first sequenza was written for Solo Flute in 1958, and like Syrinx and Density 21.5, it is a piece which does not appear to have a tonal center, but rather presents a motif and builds upon that. The motif of Berios work is not very well defined if present at all, and features very disjunct and seemingly searialist pitches. One thing I did notice in Berios piece which wasnt as evident in the other two solo flute pieces was the use of flutter tonguing. Much like the pizzicato technique, it had a very unique sound, and I think this effect would be more versatile than the light and somewhat quiet pizzicato. Overall this piece was interesting to listen to, although I didnt like it quite as much as the other two.",
"This is another flute piece by a French composer, but this time with piano accompaniment. Olivier Messiaen was an ornithologist as well as composer, and his studies in notating bird song seem to have influenced this piece in some way. Its very disjunct and seems to build upon the same fragments of music, but what interested me most about this piece was the interaction between the flute and piaNumber He scored the piano on a grand staff with two treble clefs, and he avoided the lower end of its register for the majority of the piece. This is something I had anticipated, as the resonant sound from the lower end of the piano would easily drown out the flute. I noticed that the two instruments would work in tandem with one another often. The piano might introduce an idea in the right hand and provide harmonic context with the left, and then the flute would take over the right hands role and the left hand would keep playing what it was before. I found this to be very effective in presenting material without stepping on the flutists toes. I also noticed that at times of great intensity, the piano would play block chords with the flutes melody note voiced at the top. This seemed to reinforce the sound both in terms of dynamics and timbre. I also noticed that at times the flute would weave in between the two hand of the piano player. Looking at the voicings showed that in cases where this happened, Olivier was careful to allow space for the flute to sound. There were also points where the flute and piano would play right on top of one another in very dissonant harmony. This effect was cool, as it became hard to distinguish which instrument was which. Despite the pieces seeming lack of structure, there was a coherence to it which I quite enjoyed, and it has definitely given me some ideas regarding how to approach writing the accompaniment for my flute and piano duet.",
"Ernest Charles was an American Composer of Art Songs who was active during the 20th century. He composed 45 songs for song and piano which were published by G. Schirmer, and this is one of his most popular. The piece features a very beautiful and sweeping melody. The piano accompaniment is very sparse, so as to make room for the voice to shine through. The words are set very syllabically to the music, which allows for a very natural declamation of the words. The lyrics are very easy to understand and a result, and I would imagine this piece would be incredibly useful for teaching English diction and how to properly use the IPA.",
"Astor Piazzolla was an Argentine tango composer active during the 20th century. He was a virtuosic Bandoneon composer and was also credited with creating the nuevo tango, a style of tango which developed during the 1950’s and combined elements of tango with jazz and classical music. Maria de Buenos Aires is a tango operetta composed by Piazzolla which clearly showcases the nuevo tango style. The first part of the show follows the life of a prostitute in Buenos Aires, and the second part follows her after her death. The original is very different from the original orchestration, which included a small orchestra, rhythm section, and bandoneon. The arrangement translates well however, and makes wonderful use of the trombones unique timbre and idiomatic performance mechanics. Mutes are used frequently, and the singing tone of the trombone very well parallels that of the human voice which would have originally performed the work. It has a nice balance of more heterophonic/ homophonic and polyphonic/ contrapuntal sections. Overall, a beautiful piece to listen to, and makes me want to devote some to listening to the original operetta.",
"Michael Torke is an American composer from Wisconsin. He is oftentimes associated with Post- Minimalism, and those influences can clearly be heard in his works. He is also a synesthete, which explains why many of his works’ titles are in reference to color. Bright Blue Music is one of his most popular compositions, right next to Ecstatic Orange and Javelin (which was composed on commission for the 1994 Atlanta Summer Olympics). Bright Blue Music, a piece for orchestra, is admittedly more melodious than many purely minimalist compositions. It makes use of numerous repeating rhythmic as well as melodic motives in various instrument groups. It has many very colorful textures (pun intended), and creates both a dynamic and static atmosphere. This is easily explained by the minimalist influence. It is a really beautiful piece of music and very enjoyable to listen to the whole way through.",
"I couldn’t resist including a second Torke piece. Ash, much like Bright Blue Music, exhibits many of the same minimalist influences; however, it is a markedly darker piece. It also has quite a few rather contrapuntal sections as well, which at times gives it an almost late Classical or Romanticist sound. At times it sounds a lot like Beethoven (which I am perfectly ok with). Another really beautiful piece with a really well defined character and many interesting and colorful textures.",
"Aziza is singer, pianist, and composer from Azerbaijan (a region of Iran). She comes from a family of professional musicians, and as such, was classically trained from a young age. She is known for playing and writing a jazz- mugham fusion which her father created. Mugham is an Azerbaijani folk music tradition with foundations in improvisation and modal harmony, much like jazz. It is a complex art form which weds poetry and musical improvisation. Dance of Fire is Aziza’s third album, and was released in 1995. The track personnel includes many of the foremost jazz musicians of then current times. Many of the songs seem to exhibit a bebop influence, and the presence of Azerbaijani folk music is very apparent when Aziza is singing. It can also be heard in the fast strumming patterns of the guitar, which acoustic and not the standard electric. I think the fusion comes across very well, which might be a result of the similarities between traditional Mugham music and the American Jazz tradition. A very enjoyable album with a very fresh and unique song.",
"Another symphonic poem by Lili, again in the vein of the French Impressionist Movement. The piece was commissioned in 1918, the year of her death at age 24, and it was the last piece which she composed with her own hand. The following piece was dictated. The music is very evocative of the title, A Sad Evening. It has an incredibly dark sound, with solo instrumental rages being pushed to their extremes to enhance this effect. On a much deeper level, the piece was composed right at the tail end of WWI. This coupled with her chronic case of bronchial pneumonia lends the piece to a very different emotional context than what otherwise might be inferred from the title. The piece’s ending in particular is very powerful, as it comes down from a heavy and dark orchestration to end on a minor chord which sounds borderline unresolved. Truly a beautiful piece of music, and it is certainly a shame she hadn’t lived longer. God only knows what kind of music she would have brought into the world.",
"Ravel is oftentimes considered the third leg to the triangle of French Impressionism which is comprised of himself, Lili, and his friend Debussy. Many of the stylistic techniques used by Lili and Debussy are also apparent in his compositions. Ravel also had an affinity for Spanish customs, which are apparent in this piece. Translated as Pavane for a Dead Princess, it was composed for solo piano in 1899 while Ravel was studying under Gabriel Faure. He orchestrated it in 1910. A Pavane is a slow processional dance which was popular in the 16th century (Renaissance period). It was most likely of Italian origin, but underwent heavy Spanish influence. It is typically in simple duple meter, and generally follows the form AA’BB’CC’. The original piano arrangement does not follow that form, but it does have the eb and flow of a slow processional in simple quadruple. It is very interesting to see the transition from solo piano to full orchestra. I think it translates really well, with solo passages and lush orchestrations creating a beautiful and somber sonic atmosphere. I am certain that analysis of both scores would reveal a great deal about Ravel’s style and orchestration techniques in general. It is a heartbreakingly beautiful piece, and I think it does the title justice.",
"This piece is a keyboard suite in six movements. It is modeled around the Baroque Dance Suite, with each movement being a form common during that time. The piece is supposed to emulate the keyboard style of Francois Couperin, who was an important Baroque Keyboard composer. He is credited with introducing Corelli’s Trio Sonata to France, and he was also instrumental in popularizing ordres (or dance suites). He was also noted for his detailed descriptions of ornamentation. These innovations can clearly be seen in Le Tombeau de Couperin. It is also worth noting that a Tombeau is a term used to represent a piece which memorializes the dead. In this case, each movement serves as tribute to friends which Ravel lost in WWI. Movement I is a prelude in 12/16 dedicated to First Lieutenant Jacques Charlot, who had transcribed one of Ravel’s early works for solo piaNumber The constant flow of 16th notes certainly gives the piece a Baroque feel, yet the harmonies are more indicative of a French Impressionist style. Movement II is a 4/4 fugue which Ravel dedicated to Second Lieutenant Jean Cruppi. The subject of the fugue is very anacrusic in nature, which gives the whole fugue a very suspended and ethereal quality. Incredibly beautiful. Movement III is a forlane, which is a fast, Italian Folk Dance in 6/8. It is dedicated to First Lieutenant Gabriel Deluc. It has a very lopsided feel which beautifully embraces dissonance to create a sonic atmosphere which, like the fugue, is very ethereal and suspended. I also noticed a couple Augmented Major 7th chords, which have a very distinct sound that only serves to AUGMENT this mood. Movement IV is a Rigaudon, which is a lively Baroque dance in duple meter. They tend to be simple rhythmically and have consistent phrasing. It is dedicated to Pierre and Pascal Gaudin (two brothers and childhood friends of Ravel, killed by the same shell in November 1914). Right away, the characteristics of rhythmic and phrase simplicity appear to hold true. It has a very brisk and light sound, and a middle B section (making it an ABA form) changes things up by introducing a more lyrical idea. Movement V is a Minuet, which is a French Dance in 3/4 time. It is dedicated to Jean Dreyfus (at whose home Ravel recuperated after he was demobilized). It seems harmonically and texturally simpler than the preceding movements. It is a very beautiful movement. There is one point towards the middle where he planes major chords over a drone which is displaced by an octave every other measure. I really liked how that sounded. The ending also made use of an upper structure triad (D major over G), giving it a beautiful Major 7th sonority. Movement VI is a Toccata, which is a virtuosic piece normally for keyboard instruments. It is dedicated to Captain Joseph de Marliave, a French musicologist who wrote a very popular book on Beethovens string quartets. This movement looks like a beast to play, and right away makes me think of Aram Khachaturians Toccata in Eb minor. There are many repeated notes underlying a main melodic line, executed by means of sharing the lines in hocket between the two hands. The whole suite was fantastic. I don’t think one would be able to tell that it is a memorial to lost souls without knowing what a Tombeau is, but I think the story behind the piece only serves to make it more meaningful.",
"My analysis of this piece may not be the greatest due to my limited knowledge on the genre of rap, but I will do my best at producing an apt analysis and informed opinion. There is an underlying groove produced by a synthesized drum set, as is common in the modern rap genre. I must say I am not a fan of this fact. Maybe my views of music are a bit more conservative, but I find the fact that the groove wasnt actually performed to be demeaning to the music. I also tend to view rap as being more along the lines of poetry than music due to a lack of melodic and harmonic content, so Im certain this view also affects my conservative stance. This isnt to say that music must have melody and harmony to be considered music. Percussive music and many avant- garde works such as 4’33 by John Cage also lack these elements. My personal reservations regarding the distinction are the fact that the art of rap composition and performance is more analogous to poetic studies rather than musical composition. A synthesized drum set only further supports my claim. Im not going to say the piece is bad. I havent read the lyrics, so I cannot attest to their significance nor craft, but I must say that I am not a fan of this style. I grew up listening to music which was rooted in melody, harmony, and performance. The fact that rap lacks many of these elements only serves to substantiate my opinion.",
"Seeing as though I’ve committed so much time to exploring French Impressionism, I figured I would listen to some Faure. Faure is often considered a linking figure between the end of Romanticism and the beginning of Modernism of the 20th century. His teacher was Camille Saint Saens, and he went on to teach many other famous composers including Ravel and Nadia Boulanger. Ravel’s String Quartet was actually dedicated to Faure, although his reception of it was less than ideal. He also went on to become head of the Paris Conservatoire, where he radically changed the curriculum in content and scope. As such, it is no surprise that Faure had immense influence on both the Impressionist movement but also the era of modern music in general. His Pavane is one of his better known works. It was originally written for piano, but then orchestrated in 1887. It gets its title and rhythms from the 16th century courtly Spanish Dance. There is an optional chorus notated, with lyrics regarding the helplessness of a lovestruck man. The piece opens with pizzicato strings outlining a minor chords, with solo flute playing a melismatic line over tOpus  The texture slowly grows thicker as the piece progresses, with the pizzicato strings continuing for quite some time before changing to a completely new texture. The entire time, there is a graceful eb and flow to the piece despite the textural changes. I feel as though I can definitely hear a bit of an Impressionist sound in there, but at the same time, it still sounds somewhat Romantic. The form sounds a bit more defined than what one hears in Impressionist music, and the melody line is a bit clearer and more thoroughly developed. It was a beautiful piece, but it never really seemed to reach a climax. While I do enjoy floating on the music sometimes, I felt as though this piece had a lot of potential to build to a really impactful climax. I wish that had happened. Aside from that, still a very beautiful piece.",
"This is another one of Faure’s most famous works, and it falls into the realm of the vocal world. It is part of his Opus  7 Trois Melodies, although he hadn’t composed the pieces as part of a set. They were put together long after their initial publication. Apres un reve, originally published in 1878, depicts two lovers taking flight in a dream before eventually awakening. The piano accompaniment to this piece was very simple, consisting only of 8th note block chords in the right hand and bass notes in octaves in the left hand. The musical setting was truly beautiful, and certainly seemed to play into the idea of flight into the heavens. I think a lot of this may be due to the ascending lines in the vocal melody, as well as the pulse of 8th notes in the right hand piano part. I also really liked his usage of triplets to give some of the sung vowels a bit of melisma. I can certainly understand this piece’s popularity.",
"This is the best known of Faure’s large scale works. It was composed between 1887 and 1890, and it went through many revisions before reaching its final form. It is a shortened form of the Catholic Mass for the Dead in seven movements; Introit et Kyrie, Offertory, Sanctus, Pie Jesu, Agnus Dei, Libera me, and In Paradisum. Fauré wrote of the work, Everything I managed to entertain by way of religious illusion I put into my Requiem, which moreover is dominated from beginning to end by a very human feeling of faith in eternal rest. The Introit and Kyrie opens with SATTBB singing block chords with drones in the lower strings. I really liked this sound. It had a really intense and full sound, without being too overbearing (especially since it started at pp). After that section, a bit more movement was introduced into the ensemble. I really liked how there were occasional breaks for an organ solo, harkening back to this practice in the Church during the Baroque period. I also notice that he made great use of dynamic contrast. The Offertory opens with strings playing a very lyrical phrase. It then moves into a duet between the alto and soprano voices, with each singing the same line in stretto. I really liked how this sounded. I noticed that throughout, there were a lot of suspensions, anticipations,  and retardations. This really seemed to create a lot of forward motion without too much intensity. I really liked the baritone solo in the middle section of this movement as well. I also noticed that the last few bars of the piece switched from B minor to B major for the ending. I thought this was an interesting choice. Instead of just using a Picardy third, Faure completely modulated to the parallel major key to really brighten the ending. That was really pretty. The Sanctus opens with this beautiful Eb major arpeggio ostinato in the upper strings and harp, with voices singing delicately above. This creates a lot more movement than the previous movement, and the distant tonal shift from B minor to Eb major really creates a nice contrast. There is also this really pretty countermelody in the violins which pops up frequently. For a brief moment, there is a break in the texture with lower voices singing quarter notes as orchestral tutti chords punctuate their phrases. This, along with the transition back into the initial texture before the ending, created a really beautiful movement. The Pie Jesu was only sung by a solo sopraNumber Her accompaniment was largely organ, although harp and light strings occasionally played into the timbre. This small addition added great interest. The Agnus Dei opened with Tenor solo with light orchestral accompaniment, before quickly changing to thick orchestral tutti chords and full choir. This contrast of texture and dynamics was very welcome. I also noticed that he would crescendo into a climax on a Dominant function chord, and then delay resolution. This really pushed the music forwards, created a massive amount of intensity, and truly kept me on the edge of my seat. He also brought back the theme from the Introit in D minor, and then like he did Offertory, modulated the Parallel Major key for the last few bars, bringing back the opening theme of the movement in D major. I really liked that connection back to the previous movements. The Libera Me opens with Baritone solo and light accompaniment from orchestra, with lower strings playing pizzicato quarters to drive the music forward. Towards the middle of the movement, Faure briefly bring in the Dies Irae over bombastic brass chords. The intensity is brief, as he brings the texture back down to where it initially began before ending the movement. I really liked this movement because of this contrast. It felt as though at any moment it would reach a huge, bombastic climax, without ever doing so. This felt very fitting for some reason. I imagine he might have done this so that the music fit his narrative regarding the Requiem, specifically that it is about faith in eternal rest. The final movement, In Paradisum, is truly beautiful. There wasn’t a ton of movement outside of the 16th note ostinato in the organ, and it created a really serene mood. The bass line also played around with the harmony by playing D’s and B’s underneath the D major harmony. This kept maintained interest without really moving from a tonic function harmony. It wasn’t like this for the entire movement by any means, but certain sections had a tendency of doing this. Beautiful. I can understand now why this is one of Faure’s most popular works.",
"Tracing the roots of Impressionism even further back leads to Camille Saint- Saens. He was French Composer of the Romantic Era and Faure’s teacher. He was a prodigy who made his career first as a Church Organist and then as a freelance composer. He was also a music scholar, and tended to stick with the classical forms already established by French composers before him. Despite his influences, this eventually brought him to odds with newer styles of music in his life such as Impressionism and Serialism. This irony of influencing impressionist composers as well as groups which opposed them, such as Les Six, can be drawn analogous to Wagner and Brahms. Both composers were inspired heavily by Beethoven, yet each encompassed a different school of thought regarding music (new vs. antiquated). Danse Macabre is a tone poem which Saens orchestrated from an art song by Henri Cazalis. The piece opens with a harp playing a single note 12 times, representing the striking of midnight. The violin then plays the tritone (the Devil in the Music) before moving onto the first time. The theme is passed back and forth between various instruments. He also uses the Xylophone to represent skeletons. The theme is used in a short fugal section, before giving way to a quotation of Dies Irae in a major key, and then a more lyrical variant of the theme. All of these things give the subject of a death a bit more of a lighthearted feel. It is almost as if the risen dead are having fun, as would be suggested by the title Dance of the Dead. In fact, many animated depictions of this piece display just that. Saens is very good at developing a single idea, as is evidenced in this piece. He does an incredible job of using the main theme in different contexts to evoke completely different kinds of moods. He definitely has a more Romantic sound than Faure. While they both tended to adhere to classical forms, I feel as though Faure was a bit more adventurous with his music. This may explain why he is oftentimes considered a linking figure between the Romantic period and the Modern Era. In any case, I really love this piece and can understand why Faure and Ravel, along with many others, regarded Saens as a genius.",
"This Symphony was completed in 1886 under the Royal Philharmonic Society in England. It is in two movements, has a cyclical form, and features extensive writing for keyboard instruments (including piano two and four hands as well as organ). Saens wrote that it was his best work, and that he would never again be able to top it. The first movement had some truly remarkable moments. The opening moments are soft and warm, reminding me of some of the music from the score to Up. The material evolves in Sonata Allegro form, going through a variety of moods and textures. The moment which got me the most was when the organ first made its entrance about halfway through the movement. The strings layered over top created an incredibly rich, sonorous, and full timbre which overwhelmed me. The ending of the movement did the same. I also really liked how there were a couple short solos for the organ. Seeing how it is a somewhat unusual instrument for an orchestra, I liked how it got some time to breathe before having other parts of the orchestra enter. One thing about the movement which I was not a fan of were these little sections of pizzicato in the low strings. They almost seemed to pop up out of nowhere, and although they were eventually resolved with more material, they made some of the sections feel disconnected and disrupted. The Second movement was so badass. It started with a really energetic theme in the strings, and only continued to get better from there. Some of the piano playing became more prominent, and that was a really welcome sound. The organ really started to pull out the stops (pun intended), and that really gave the orchestra a huge, full, amazing sound. The finale was incredible for this reason. It kept going back and forth on these cadential 6/4’s before finally resolving, and with orchestral tutti on top of organ, it was incredibly grand. Overall the piece was awesome. The main theme from the second movement is supposedly really popular, and although I didn’t latch onto it at first, a second listen did make it stick in my head a bit better. It was used in the movie Babe, and after listening to a bit of its soundtrack, I can very clearly hear the adapted melody. I think I liked this piece more so for organ, however. It is the namesake of the symphony, and it was a super cool choice on the end of Saens which really made this piece distinct and memorable. It is also worth mentioning that the piece was dedicated to Franz Liszt, a good friend of Saens, when he passed away only a few months after its premiere.",
"This is another of Saen’s most well known pieces. It is a work in 14 movements for an ad hoc ensemble of two pianos, strings, flute, piccolo, clarinet, and glass armonica (oftentimes substituted by glockenspiel). The piece is a humorous work which Saens wrote in 1886 after a failed concert tour and before finishing his third symphony. The work features many musical allusions to other composers’ works, and uses various techniques to mimic characteristics of the movement animal. The first movement, Introduction et marche royale du lion (Introduction and Royal March of the Lion), opens with tremolo pianos and a stately theme played in the strings. It then moves on to a march like figure played in piano, which continues through to the end of the movement. Both strings and piano play heavy patterns in the lower ends of their registers, as if to imitate the sound of a lions roar. I enjoyed this effect, and must say that I also like the main melody. I have a feeling it is going to be stuck in my head for a while. The second movement, Poules et coqs (Hens and Roosters), opens with a staccato 8th note pattern with accents on various notes. This idea is passed around between various instruments for the whole movement, creating the impression of chickens and hens pecking. At some points he used stretto to offset the entrances of this idea, and I thought that the effect worked really well with an idea comprised of repeated notes and random accents. It is worth mentioning that the main theme is from Jean- Philippe Rameau’s Harpsichord Suite in G minor, La Poule. The third movement, Hémiones (animaux véloces) (Wild Donkeys Swift Animals), consists of very brisk sixteenth note runs in both pianos ending on a perfect authentic cadence. I think this simple idea represents ‘Swift Animals’ well. The fourth movement, Tortues (Tortoises), gets its main theme from the piece Gallop Infernal from Offenbach’s operetta Orphee aux Enfers. It is played at a much slower tempo, with pianos playing a reharmonized progression in triplets (thus created a hemiola throughout). It was honestly such a beautiful and serene rendition of a piece which is known for being the antithesis of such a characterization. I really liked this movement. The fifth movement, LÉléphant (The Elephant), opens with a double bass solo. Saens again borrows from another work, this time Dance of the Sylphs by Hector Berlioz from The Damnation of Faust. He also borrows some stuff from the Scherzo of A Midsummer Night’s Dream  by Felix Mendelssohn. Both of these pieces had the themes scored for upper woodwinds and strings, and the joke Saens makes is moving those themes to the lowest instrument, the double bass, for the Elephant movement. I think this came across really well, and the piece certainly stands well on its own. The sixth movement, Kangourous (Kangaroos), features an open fifth grace note theme played by the two pianos. As the fifths jump upwards, the dynamics and tempo grow, and as they fall back down, they decrease. This effect is meant to be reminiscent of the hopping of Kangaroos. I think this effect is really cool for solo instruments, but I don’t think it would translate effectively into a larger ensemble. The seventh movement, Aquarium, features more instruments of the ensemble, including the glass armonica. One piano plays a 6 on 1 ostinato, while the other plays a 10 on 1. The main theme is very melismatic and is played in muted strings and flute. One of the main harmonic motives used is a i- IV movement, which is very common in film scores meaning to evoke a mystical quality. He also briefly used an octatonic scale, which is another familiar tactic. I really liked this movement, and a lot of it felt very impressionistic for obvious reasons. The eighth movement, Personnages à longues oreilles (Characters with Long Ears), is a short movement for two violins. It basically consisted of a chromatically moving line underneath a high, shrill note like what was heard in the soundtrack to Psycho. I wasn’t a huge fan of this movement. Movement nine, Le Coucou au fond des bois (The Cuckoo in the Depths of the Woods), is scored for two pianos and clarinet. The clarinet only plays two notes, a C and Ab, for the entire movement, mimicking the sound of a cuckoo bird. The piano play resonant but soft chords underneath for the entirety of the piece, as if to represent the depths of the woods from which the bird is calling. It reminded me a bit of the chorale like figure the strings have throughout the piece The Unanswered Question by Charles Ives. The constant, underlying solidification of harmony with other instruments acting out above it is a really gorgeous sound, even in the case of the Ives piece. The tenth movement, Volière (Aviary), is a quick, light movement with flute taking a leading role. The pianos helped to accent certain parts of the melody and add some color, but the primary source of harmonic context was in the tremolo strings playing in the background throughout. This technique is very reminiscent of the orchestral stylings of Debussy, and it makes me wonder if this was a source of inspiration on that technique. The eleventh movement, Pianistes, pokes fun at beginning piano students practicing their scales. Each scale is rhythmically patterned, as one would do when learning scales, and when each pattern is finished, a large tutti orchestral chord is played before moving onto the next key. It is definitely worth mentioning that this piece ends unresolved, with the resolution coming to fruition in the next movement. Movement twelve, Fossiles (Fossils), picks up where the previous piece left off. This movement has many musical allusions, such as to Ah Vous Dirai Maman by Mozart, Una Voce Poco fa from The Barber of Seville by Rossini, as well as Danse Macabre by Saens himself. Leonard Bernstein said the joke is the these pieces were the fossils of Saen’s time. The thirteenth movement, Le cygne (The Swan), is probably the most well known of all the movements. It has been arranged for many different solo instruments, and even set to dance. The two pianos play flowing lines of sixteenth notes and rolled chords as if to represent the water in which the swan swims. The melody of this piece really stuck out to me. It was so simple, yet it had so much character and beauty to it. It It seemed to have two main rhythmic ideas, one used at the beginning, the second used for the following two measures, and then the fourth filled with an agogic stress. The piece also seemed to follow an ABA form, with the A being a statement of the melody, and the B being an exploration of the melody through various tonal and harmonic contexts. It seemed to shift around to E minor and B minor, which both have a mediant relationship to the home key of G major. I thought that some of the harmonies he used to shift to these tonal centers sounded very Chopin- esque, and I quite enjoyed them. One such example was the movement G- A#dim7/G- F#7- Bm/F#- F#7- Bm. This movement creates a really seamless transition in Bm, and also made me realize something about fully diminished seventh chords. Since they are only one half step away from being dominant seventh, and they are a symmetrical chords, any tone can be lowered a half step to create a dominant seventh chord. This is what Saens did here. The jump from G to A# would have sounds funny, which is why he left the G in the bass. He could then move that down a half step to F#, creating an F#7 chord to resolve to Bm. You can almost think of the G in the bass as a suspension, while the upper harmony moves into an F#7 area before the bass gets there. A really cool effect that I will definitely exploit in the future. This was a really beautiful movement, and I can understand why it has enjoyed such enduring popularity. The last movement is simply titled Finale, and it serves to tie the whole piece together. It has its own, simple theme, but many other movements are quoted, including the opening piano chords, the lion, the donkey, and the kangaroo, to name a few. Overall, I really liked this work. At times you could tell it was just meant to be a fun piece to write, but I think this only adds to the charm of it.",
"Tailleferre was the only female composer in the group known as Les Six. This was a group of six French Composers who all studied at the Paris Conservatory and knew of each other. The term was coined by Henri Collet, a composer and music critic, and consisted of Georges Auric (1899–1983), Louis Durey (1888–1979), Arthur Honegger (1892–1955), Darius Milhaud (1892–1974), Francis Poulenc (1899–1963), and Germaine Tailleferre (1892–1983). The composers occasionally collaborated on music, but otherwise were simply part of the group as a result of conveniency. Although the composers developed along their own lines, a general trend in their music shows a reaction against the music of Impressionist composers like Debussy, Ravel, and Lili. Tailleferre’s string quartet, written in 1919, demonstrates this point. While some of the sonorities are reminiscent of an Impressionist style, the clarity of line, form, and texture are more along the lines of a neoclassical approach. The first movement seems to be modeled around a Ternary (ABA) form, with the B section introducing an idea independent of the one presented in the A section. The following are the the two themes I identified. The first theme is clearly specific to the A section, while the second is specific to the B section. This clarity is something which was generally avoided in Impressionist music. As Debussy put it, Works of art make rules; rules do not make works of art. It is also safe to say that texturally, Tailleferre’s quartet is simpler than what one would see in a work by Ravel, Debussy, or Lili. There is less exploration of color from a technical standpoint on the instrument (fingered tremolos, pizzicato, et cetera), and there are also less moving lines. These comparisons are not meant to demean Taillferre’s work. Her string quartet is certainly a beautiful piece of music. It’s more so to point out the fact that the time and place she was in was ideal for an Impressionist style, yet she and the others in Les Six took a different approach to composition.",
"Mary Lou Williams was a Pianist, arranger, and performer, known in particular for her contributions in the jazz world. She was a child prodigy, and was supporting her family by playing at age age six. She went on to work alongside some of the great jazz musicians of her time, including Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, Thelonious Monk, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis, Tadd Dameron, Bud Powell, and Dizzy Gillespie. In 1956, she converted to Roman Catholicism, and much of her music after that time was religious jazz. Black Christ of the Andes, released in 1963, is an example of this. It is a hymn for choir and piano which is in honor of St. Martin de Pores of Peru. The piece is largely unaccompanied for the majority of its duration, with Williams only playing a short piano solo in the middle with the choir only singing hits. The rest of the time, they sing without any playing. The harmony is very clearly indicative of a jazz style, and every time they sing the line St. Martin de Pores, it has a different harmonization. I really like the style of this piece. The unaccompanied choir singing jazz harmonies has a very cool sound, and it is something I might like to give a try in the near future.",
"We listened to this piece in beginning comp today and I thought it would be worth doing a listening log on. This string quartet is a tale about a man who loses his mind and is forced to spend the rest of his life in prison. Movement 3, Inner Demons, specifically explores his descent into madness. The tale is based upon a prior boyfriend of the composer, who she later found out turned into a serial killer and was placed in prison. The movement is based upon three Appalachian folk tunes which he sed to whistle, and as the piece progresses, you can hear those tunes slowly become for perverse and erratic. This is accomplished through chromaticism, extended techniques such as con lengo, glissandos, and stops, as well as various transformative measures such as inversion and fragmentation. These things are very evident as one listens to the piece, and I really like the effect. I also loved how there were fleeting moments of beautiful, almost chorale like textures which eventually fell back into chaos. Its almost as if these moments represent the last good parts of the man’s mind as they are infected by the insanity. Another really cool effect Garrop made use of was contrapuntal double stops in Violins I and II about halfway through the piece. She easily could have scored some of the lines for Viola, but in using the double stops, she created a more homogenous sound which is reminiscent of the Fiddle which these folk tunes would originally have been played on. A really interesting piece which did a great job at conveying the storyline.",
"Britten was a 20th century English Composer. His contributions were great, end included vocal works, operas, orchestral works, and chamber ensemble works. Some of his better known pieces are War Requiem, A Young Person’s Guide to the Orchestra, Turn of the Screw, and Peter Grimes. He was also known for his controversial friendships with young boys, although there is no proof of any wrongdoing. The Ash Grove is a traditional Welsh folk tune which Britten arranged for Soprano voice and piano accompaniment. What strikes me right away about this piece is the elegant simplicity of the piano part. It consists largely of one line, played in parallel sixths for the majority of the piece. There is a slight change in texture towards the middle section, where the left hand will roll a chord while the right hand continues playing that line. This section was also of interest to me, as the vocal melody stayed mostly the same, but the reharmonization was significant. Since the form of this piece appears to be Strophic, this variation is very welcome and colorful. This is definitely a composition device which I would like to explore further. Overall a really beautiful piece.",
"This piece is an 18th century Italian Art Song traditionally attributed to Pergolesi, but is now more often credited to Vincenzo Ciampi. It is a piece which exhibits a man’s efforts to awake Nina from her slumber. I don’t have a ton to say about this piece other than that I like the melody a lot, especially the little melismatic turn which happens towards the end of the second phrase. There is also a bit of word painting as the man exclaims Cymbals, Drums, and Shawms! The music becomes lowder and markedly more percussive as the man theorizes ways to wake Nina. A nice, short piece which is very popular in Italian Diction classes!",
"I was reminded of this piece today by a friend of mine. We played it last year in Area All State. Its just a really pretty piece which does an incredible job building and releasing tension through dynamic and textural changes. There are also a ton of suspensions which give it a really powerful sound. The opening figure is really amazing. I believe it is Oboe solo with Clarinets providing a harmonic pad. It has a really lovely sound. I also noticed that he made use of a lot of moving lines as well as hocket. Again, it just gives the piece a really serene intensity. A really beautiful piece with a lot of really powerful moments.",
"Ah Bernstein. This man doesn’t need much context given his vast success and acclaim. He was one of the first conductors born and educated in the US to receive international fame. Many of his works are incredibly well known, especially his modern adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, titled West Side Story. He was also a crucial figure in the modern revival in the music of Mahler, who he drew great inspiration from. He also hosted a series of televised programs called The Young People’s Concerts. This clarinet sonata, written in 1941, was the first of his published works. It has become a staple of the clarient canon, despite mixed reviews upon its premiere. It is piece in two movements dedicated to David Oppenheim, an American clarinetist of great esteem. Right away I notice that the accompaniment is very sparse compared to what I normally write. Oftentimes, there are only one or two lines going on underneath the clarinet. Sometimes they act as a continuation of the clarinet’s line, and other times as a complimentary figure. There was one part I liked in particular where the clarient dropped really low into its register on a drone note, and the piano played a line in octaves much higher up in its register. The large distance between the two instruments was a really nice break from what was largely within an octave before, and the textural break also accompanied a change in melodic content, which only further emphasized the difference. In the second movement, I noticed that the piano would quote a lot of the motives which the clarinet has. The created a sense of unity between the parts, and also helped the listener latch onto important ideas. This is something which I do a little in my writing, but definitely not as extensively as maybe I should. Definitely something I will give a try. I loved when he had a line in the piano which was in parallel motion on the 3rd or 6th with the clarient. The timbres of the two instruments are somewhat similar in their percussive attack, and it seemed to create the illusion of more than two clarinets playing. I also notice there were times when the two hands of the piano played in hocket with one another. I really liked the effect this created. Overall a really cool piece, and its definitely given me some ideas about how to better approach my writing for piano accompaniment!",
"Brahms, next to Wagner, made up one half of the Romantic Era approach to music. Often considered to be amongst the ranks of Johanne Sebastian Bach and Beethoven, he was adamant about using traditional forms in his music (hence why the whole Wagner vs. Brahms thing developed). He had a close friendship with the Schumanns. He was also an intense perfectionist, and often destroyed his own works even after having spent years working on them. In any case, his music still comprises a large portion of modern concert repertoire.  His two Clarinet Sonatas in F minor and Eb major were written in 1894, after he swore retirement from composing in 1890. They are both dedicated to Richard Mühlfeld, a talented clarinetist, and represent a gem in the clarinet repertoire. The first in F minor is in 4 movements. The first is in Sonata- Allegro, and opens with figure in the piaNumber Again, the accompaniment throughout is significantly less intricate than what I normally write, however, there appears to be more counterpoint than in the Bernstein. The piano part alone sounds very Beethoven- esque. This is to be expected from Brahms, given his sources of influence. Again, there is a lot of motivic quoting in the piano part, and oftentimes, the piano and clarinet work in hocket to create a sense of one line. Sometimes it seemed that the piano had some very pianistic figure. This creates a sort of which came first, the chicken or the egg? scenario. It’s hard to tell if the piano is quoting the clarient or visa versa, and though my money is on the former, it is a cool effect in any case. The second movement is in ternary form, and opens with a descending theme in the piano and sparse accompaniment in the piaNumber The accompaniment in this whole movement is very sparse, giving the clarinetist a lot of room to breath. Movement three is also in ternary form, and opens with a very waltzy feel. I noticed that he took the piano accompaniment and offset the left and right hand figures by an eighth note. This was a really simple and effective way to create a sense of forward motion and textural interest. I also noticed than instead of arpeggiating a full 4 eighth notes in the left hand, he only arpeggiated three. I normally would have done all 4, but the problem with that is the need to pick up the last note with the right hand (depending on the size of the interval). Instead, he uses an anacrusis in the right hand to keep the momentum going and to free up the right hand to play foreseeably anywhere in the range of the piaNumber This is something I could definitely borrow, as when I use these kinds of pianistic figures, I find the melody line getting trapped around the bottom of the treble clef to pick up the left hands line. Something related to this can also be seen in the fourth movement (which is in modified rondo form). He starts the figurations up high and then descends. This frees up the melody to play elsewhere in the pianos range, and allows the left hand to strike a bass note before picking up the line. It also creates an almost cascading kind of sound, which could definitely be useful in certain settings. I think I’ve gotten stuck doing my figurations because I want to build the chords from the bottom up. If I can get out of the headspace, I think my piano writing will experience a lot more freedom.",
"Another piece from Berio. Last semester I listened to his first Sequenza for solo Flute. I wasn’t a huge fan of that piece, so I’m curious to see how I will like this one. Circles was written in 1960 as a setting of three E. E. Cummings poems. Berio wrote the piece for his wife, Cathy Berberian, and he wanted to experiment with creating some of the electroacoustical sounds he pioneered using only acoustic instruments. The piece is scored for female voice, harp, and two percussionists. At the beginning of the score, he indicates specific notational devices he uses for the percussion and harp parts. In this way, he is able to notate effects he may not have been able to otherwise with more standard notation. The form is ABCBA, or arch form, and thus forms a circle like the title implies. An interesting thing I notice him doing with the voice is breaking down individual words into their constituent syllables and really playing around with those sounds. He also seems to have the other accompanimental parts complement those sounds. For example, when the voice is singing an -s (like a hiss, voiceless alveolar fricative in IPA), he has the snare drum doing a light roll to match that sound. While I’m not a huge fan of this piece, I think there is something really interesting to be said about it’s character. The whole thing sounds very sporadic and almost aleatoric, but in reality, it’s notation is highly organized and complex. Hidden within what seems like chaos is an incredibly high degree of organization and control. I think this juxtaposition of expectation versus reality is, in a way, really beautiful. It is also worth mentioning that E. E. Cummings was known for his modernist, free- form poetry, so in a lot of ways, the nature of this piece only further serves the text.",
"George Crumb is a 20th century American composer of Modern Classical and Avant- Garde music. He is known for exploring unusual timbres, extended techniques, and unusual forms of notations. His best known works include Black Angels and Makrokosmos, the latter of which is in reference to Bartok’s Mikrokosmos. Lux Aeterna, Latin for Eternal Light, was written in 1971. It is a chamber work for Soprano, Bass Flute/Soprano Recorder, Sitar, and two Percussionists. This unusual instrumentation lends itself to a very, for lack of a better term, exotic sound in Western ears. I feel as though this perception proves useful in trying to convey the idea of Eternal Light, as it has an almost ethereal sound. The piece seems to be lacking in defined melodic and harmonic content, but I feel as though this is irrelevant in a piece where the emphasis is placed upon timbral and textural effects. I actually quite like this piece for that reason, despite the fact that I normally tend to prefer music with more defined harmonic and melodic content. The sonic atmosphere is the emphasis here, and I think Crumb does a good job creating one which feels unique and natural.",
"Caroline Shaw is a living, contemporary composer. Her Partita for 8 Voices was composed for the group Roomful of Teeth, an a cappella ensemble which experiments with non- traditional vocal techniques from cultures around the world. The piece won the Pulitzer Prize for music in 2013. The whole piece is structured like a Baroque dance suite, or Partita, and consists of an Allemande, Sarabande, Courante, and Passacaglia. To me, the piece screamed Philip Glass in a lot of parts, particularly his work Einstein on the Beach. Her use of minimalist techniques and descriptive phrases for the text substantiate this claim. I also enjoyed the various vocal techniques employed, including throat singing, singing on closed vowels, whispering, and even just spoken word. Even with the diverse range of sounds used, Shaw still managed to make the piece sound connected and seamless. I will certainly be checking out more works by her and Roomful of Teeth.",
"After watching The Shining last night, I decided I would do a listening log on the composer of the soundtrack, Wendy Carlos. I unfortunately could not find the influential album anywhere online, save for originals selling for over 100$. Despite this, I decided I would still do a listening log on the album due to its importance and listen to a cover of one of the tracks in its place. Wendy Carlos, born Walter Carlos, was an American composer known for her work with Robert Moog in popularizing the Moog Synthesizer in popular music, as well as for being one of the first popular figures to disclose having undergone gender reassignment surgery. She was also known for her work in scoring films, especially with producer Stanley Kubrick. Switched- On Bach was her first studio album released in 1968 under her original birth name Walter. The album topped American and UK Charts for its renditions of popular Bach works with a Moog Synthesizer. The album was pivotal both for bringing synthesized music out of the avant- garde realm and into the public sphere. The closest thing I could find to the original album was a cover of Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto Number 5 in D major. BWV 1050, 1. Allegro by the YouTube channel Carey R. Meltz. AS he put it, In homage to Wendy Carlos original realization recorded on her Switched-On Bach II of 1973, I scored my version with fairly basic instruments reminiscent of her style. Without having heard the original album, I must say that I quite enjoyed the rendition. I think Bach’s contrapuntal, moving, Baroque style lends itself well to the various timbres of a synthesizer. I will definitely be keeping an eye open for the original album, and if I come across it somewhere, I will be sure to update this entry.",
"People have been suggesting that I listen to this piece of music for quite a long while now, and since Tiv conducted an arrangement of it last night at his conducting recital, I figured it was as good a time as any to give the full thing a listen. Carl Orff was a German composer active during a large part of the 20th century. There has been a lot of debate as to his involvement with or resistance against the Nazi Party, but as there are many differing accounts, this area is somewhat grey. It is worth noting that his Carmina Burana was beloved by the Nazi party, and after Felix Mendelssohn’s music was banned, the Nazi Regime called on Orff to write new incidental music for A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Orff is also known for developing a novel approach to music education known as Orff Schulwerk, which uses movement, singing, playing, and improvisation. Carmina Burana was composed in 1935 and is a musical setting of the text of the same name. The original text was written during the 11th and 12th centuries by Goliards, young clergymen who protested the Catholic Church through poetry and music, and many of the texts/ songs are bawdy, irreverent, and satirical. Orff’s setting is a cantata, which is a typically multi- movement piece involving choir and instrumental accompaniment. This harkens back to the Baroque Era when Cantatas, Operas, and Oratorios were on the uprise. The piece contains five major sections along with introductory and ending material, forming a total of twenty five movements. The surrounding two sections, Fortuna Imperatrix Mundi, or Fortune, Empress of the World, have become very well- known and are often used in film scores. It is also worth mentioning that the original Carmina Burana text has an image of a wheel of fortune on the front, and the structure of Orff’s piece often reflects this circular nature of life. The opening section is really powerful and intense, effectively establishing the overall theme of the piece. The subsequent movements don’t sound at all how I expected. The instrumental accompaniment is often very sparse, the text setting is mostly syllabic/ neumatic, and polyphony is rarely heard. The text is super easy to hear as such, and this combined with solo arias gives the piece a very Classical sound at times. It is also worth noting that the piece is often rhythmically complex at times, but since the prosody of the text lines up with the rhythms, it goes mostly unnoticed. I noticed the tenor aria is sung almost entirely falsetto, thus adding to the satirical nature of the movement and the strife the swan feels as it is being roasted alive. In fact, I really enjoyed the entire Tavern section. The opening of the Courtly Love Section sounds really familiar.",
"I have never listened to any of the Mahler symphonies despite their widespread popularity, so I figured I would give one a try. Mahler was a Austro- Bohemian composer and conductor of the Late Romantic Period, and he is often seen as bridging the gap between Romanticism and Modernism. Many of the world’s leading composers and conductors have cited him as an influence, and his works still represent a staple of modern concert repertoire. His First Symphony follows a pretty traditional four movement form and is loosely programmatic. One thing I’m noticing right away is how much restraint Mahler uses. He spends a lot of time exploring different ideas/ textures, and he takes a long time to build any climax. I quite like this approach, as it encourages more active listening and makes the payoff of the eventual climaxes more impactful. I’m coming to find that I really enjoy his melodies. They are very catchy despite their simplicity, and he manages to generate a lot of unique material from them. They also tend to end unresolved, which allows him to keep the energy spinning forward until he decides to change things up. I have also noticed that he tends to have little secondary ideas to go along with each melody, and this anchor helps to keep things grounded as he develops the melodic material. This is why, despite his adventurousness during developmental sections, things never seem to stray too far from home. The third movement opens with a Contrabass Solo on the theme of Freres Jacques, and although I wasn’t necessarily a huge fan of the sound, it was unique and interesting nonetheless. He also matches the registral extremes of the Contrabass solo with little flourishes high in the oboes and clarinets, further contributing to the strained sound. He also begins to add in chromatic embellishments and has cymbals playing offbeats, giving the section an almost Klezmer sound. That last movement was so exciting and powerful! Mahler practices incredible restraint in his writing. There are a million opportunities for climax, but he saves it for very choice movements. I can understand why people like him so much! I will definitely be listening to some more of his symphonies, maybe some of his other works, and definitely more composers like him.",
"I’ve heard mention of this piece many times, so I decided to finally give it a listen. Krzysztof Penderecki is a Polish composer and conductor who is well known for his larger ensemble repertoire. He boasts four operas, eight symphonies and other orchestral pieces, a variety of instrumental concertos, choral settings of mainly religious texts, as well as chamber and instrumental works. I also found it interesting that some of his works snuck their way into The Shining and The Exorcist, which are two of my favorite horror films. His Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima (1960) is a lament for those lives lost during the first usage of an atomic weapon. Krzysztof Penderecki wrote the piece first, and then upon hearing it performed, dedicated it to the event. It is scored for fifty two string instruments and has some basis in aleatory, allowing players to decide which techniques to use at certain times. The piece makes use of various extended techniques and registral extremes, giving it a very unsettling and chaotic sound. About two minutes in, he drops back the chaos and brings forward simple drone notes which are reminiscent of air raid sirens and airplanes flying overhead. Obviously this wasn’t an intentional choice since he dedicated the piece after writing it, but it fits really well nonetheless. I can almost feel the panic building within me as the sirens wail and the screams fill the air. Overall a really unsettling and powerful piece which makes amazing use of various creative timbres and tone clusters/ sound walls. I found a video that shows the score. It’s much more graphical than I had expected, but I suppose it shouldn’t be surprising. Some aspects of it, including the approximate time values, seemed a lot like George Crumb. Very interesting.",
"Percy Grainger is an Australian- born composer and pianist. He first made his name as a concert pianist and then as a composer/ collector of original folk melodies. He formed friendship with Edvard Grieg, Ralph Vaughan Williams, Debussy, Edward Elgar, and Frederick Delius and became an adamant fan of Nordic culture and music, often to a racist and anti- semitic extent. His compositions tend to be shorter works with a basis in English and Nordic folk tunes. His In a Nutshell Suite was written in 1916 and consists of four movements: Arrival Platform Humlet, Gay but Wistful, Pastoral, and The Gum-Suckers March. The first movement did not sound at all like I was expecting. I could definitely here a folk tune influence but it was different than ‘normal’ orchestrations. His writing is a bit more ambitious than something by say Ralph Vaughan Williams or Edward Elgar, as if they had a child with John Williams. Although the sound caught me off guard at first, I didn’t mind it in the least. I quite enjoyed the second movement as well. The folk tune influence is much more evident here, but again, his orchestration seems to be reaching for more. The third movement defied any expectation I had. It was rich texturally, rhythmically, harmonically, and timbrally. His use of mixed meter was very evident and gave the movement a very lush sound, almost Impressionistic in nature. His use of instruments such as Glockenspiel, Tubular Bells, Celeste, and Harp only add to this sonic atmosphere. I should also point out that in all the movements thus far, his concert pianist influence is very evident. His piano parts take on a heavier role than what other composers might right, and as such have a very prominent sound at times. The last movement sounds more along the lines of what I had expected, and I might venture to say that it sounded Copland- esque before Copland was composing in earnest. An interesting piece, and I’d be curious to see who Grainger has influenced.",
"I decided to listen to another piece by Lili since I’ve come to really enjoy her music. I’m not really hunting for anything in particular while listening, but I am rather just listening for enjoyment. This piece is Lili’s third Psalm setting, and translated it means From the Depths of the Abyss. This mood explains why her harmony was unusually dark, placing extreme emphasis on Phrygian sonorities. I really liked this piece.",
"Seeing how Holst is one of my favorite composers, I don’t feel an introduction is necessary. I found this piece by him tonight, and it’s quite a nice little overture. It was written in 1922, and I feel as though it represents his style well. It’s inventive and interesting, but it still maintains a relatively ‘classical’ sound. I’ve always found it interesting that Holst manages to do this, such as he does with The Planets or The Cloud Messenger, especially when one compares those pieces to his Second Military Suite in F. His range of capabilities as a composer always manages to impress me. I would also like to point out how well the fugual elements translated into a fully orchestrated overture. I really like the sound of a good fugue, and I think he does an amazing job giving it justice here.",
"This piece, which translates as The People United Will Never Be Defeated, is part of the Nueva Cancion Chilena, or New Chilean Song Movement. This genre arose in Iberian America during the 60’s and is based in folk tune traditions and socially/ politically committed lyrics. This piece was composed in 1973 by Sergio Ortega but was later popularized internationally by the group Inti Illimani. The piece became an anthem for the Popular Unity party, a left- wing Chilean party which stood behind the election of Salvador Allende during the 1970 presidential election, and later a battle cry of resistance against the Pinochet Regime, a US backed dictator who overthrew Salvador Allende in 1973 and ended civilian rule in Chile. I really like this piece both for its message as well as its very apparent folk tune influence. The bassline follows a Do-Te-Le-Sol movement before moving into a circle of fifths progression. Its so simple, yet so effective. I suppose this is part of the reason why it became so popular and successful with the masses. There is also some basic counterpoint which occurs during the end of the Inti Illimani cover which sounds very cool. On the whole, a wonderful piece which I would love to hear being sung by hundreds of people.",
"Rzewski is an American composer and pianist known for works which incorporate political and social themes. His best known works are Coming Together, a setting of letters written during the times of the famous Attica, NY Prison Riots, as well as this piece. Written in 1976, this piece is a set of variations on the theme of  El Pueblo Unido Jamas Sera Vencido. There are thirty six variations total, organized into six groups of six. The initial statement of the theme is really enjoyable to listen two, starting out relatively simple and then slowly building into a rousing climax. The first variation is so amazingly simple, yet incredibly effective. It is a single line with the notes displaced into various octaves of the keyboard. It is still distinguishable as the theme, yet it works so well as a variation. The following five variation slowly move further away from the initial theme. The are still distinguishable as being derived from the same idea, yet I feel as though they could function as independent works. One thing I think he is doing is building some of his variations around that displaced melody, which is why a hint of the original content is still present, yet sounds very different in a lot of ways. The fifth variation uses a technique worth mentioning. He indicated hitting an initial chord staccato, and then catching the harmonic of that chord with the pedal. This is a really unique technique which I feel has a really cool effect. It sounds almost ethereal and ringing like a bell. I also noticed that variation six seems to be a summary of the five variations that came before it, combining elements from each of them into one conglomerate. The eleventh variation is very interesting in its use of extended techniques. It has an ossia slam keyboard lid, small vocal cry, and whistle. These short, timbral bursts of sound work really well with the piaNumber The twelfth variation is fucking amazing! It is again a summary on the prior five variations, as was the sixth movement, but he also brings back the original theme in all of its glory right before moving on to the next variation. Not only does this ground the listener back to the original idea, but man does it hit you like a sack of bricks. I actually got chills! The twelfth movement seemed to quote another piece, and after searching, I found out it is a piece called Bandiera Rosa, or Red Flag, which became a symbol of the Socialist Italian Labor Movement. The eighteenth movement is again a recap of the prior five movements. This whole piece is like a really exciting and auditory game of Where’s Waldo. Variation twenty four is another recap variation, as well as number thirty. Variation thirty one appears to be a variation on number six, which in turn makes it a variation on a variation of five movements. Variation thirty two is a variation on number twelve, thirty three on eighteen, thirty four on twenty four, and thirty five on thirty. Variation thirty six is another recap variation, and since the previous five variations are recaps of the piece thus far, the entire work is contained within the thirty sixth variation. Really creative and incredible way of structuring the piece, my mind is completely blown! I think it is really interesting how Rzewski affords the performer an up to five minute improvisatory cadenza at the end of the thirty sixth variation as well, almost like a palate cleanse of sorts after hearing the entire piece summarized in one two minute variation. Then he brings back the theme one last time before ending the piece, allowing us to hear what we initially heard through an entirely new lense after such a long and exciting journey. What an awesome piece of music!",
"Richard Strauss was a leading German composer of the Late Romantic and Early Modern Periods. Along with Mahler, he represents the continued progression of German Romanticism towards more adventurous orchestrations and harmonic devices which Wagner had begun introducing. Also Sprach Zarathustra, translated as Thus Spoke Zarathustra, was composed in 1896 and is based on the Friedrich Nietzsche novel of the same name. The book chronicles the travels and speeches of Zarathustra, an entity named after the oldest still active religion on earth. The philosophy of the book proposes that Mankind is simply a transitional race between animals and the Übermensch, or the perfect form of humanity. The book argues that God is dead and that humankind is moving towards a form of self- motivation which resembles the doctrines of religions. It also mentions Nietzsche’s concept of Eternal Recurrence, which is that both the joys and horrors of life are doomed to repeat themselves indefinitely and that acceptance of this fact is necessary to becoming the Übermensch. The book also shows an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert nihilism in all of its varied forms. This thematic material makes it clear why Stanley Kubrick used the opening moments of Strauss’s piece in 2001: A Space Odyssey, as the whole movie is about tracing humanity from its most primal origins to the peak of it’s evolution. It makes me beg the question: is the monolith Zarathustra? The piece is organized into nine sections, each named after selected chapters from the book. The piece as a whole is incredibly dramatic, and I can definitely see why Mahler and Strauss are oftentimes viewed in a similar light. I don’t have a ton to say in specific about the work, other than that I like it and I think it is a very interesting representation of Nietzsche’s novel. I did notice that the three note motif of the opening fanfare pops up a lot, as if representing mankind’s struggle towards greatness within the universe. This is further accented by the fact that the piece ends unresolved, with the upper strings and winds playing a B major chord while the lower voices drone a C. The way I see it, this represents one of two things. A) Strauss was not satisfied by the answers which Zarathustra sought to provide, or B) Humanity is still fighting to become the Übermensch and attain unity with the universe. In either case, it was a fascinating piece with an incredibly interesting story behind it.",
"Schoenberg doesn’t need much of an introduction, as he is very well known for his development of twelve tone serialism which is still studied to this day. This piece, Transfigured Night, was written very early in his output (1899, Opus  4) and represents a more tonal side of Schoenbergs music. The string sextet is based on the Richard Dehmel poem of the same, and as such, is one of the earliest examples of program music for a chamber ensemble. The piece is roughly divided into five sections with each corresponding to the five stanzas of the poem: I really enjoyed this piece. One thing which I found to be interesting was, despite the fact that this was a string sextet, it still sounded a lot like a string quartet. I am in no way undermining Schoenbergs writing, but rather am complementing those quartets by individuals like Debussy, Tailleferre, and Shostakovich. It is incredible how much music they can produce from so few instruments! I can again see why this piece is often seen as carrying forth the traditions of Late German Romanticism. The whole piece has a characteristic brooding darkness about it with interpositions of lyrical beauty which gave me chills. It is also interesting to see how this piece might be seen as a stepping stone towards the twelve tone serialism which Schoenberg would later create. It’s always been said that the progression towards that system was the result of slowly breaking the rules, and tracing the progression of this music from Beethoven to Wagner and then Mahler, Schoenberg, and Strauss clearly shows this deviation from the norm. On the whole a great piece, and I will definitely be looking into some more of Schoenberg’s early works.",
"Mahler’s second symphony was composed in 1894 and is often considered to be not only one of his greatest works, but also one of the greatest symphonies. It has five movements and has a loose program regarding life and death, although Mahler removed all versions of the program later on in his life. The piece is pretty good, but I honestly don’t like it as much as the first one. A lot of the movements feel as though they are made up of may sections with awkward little pauses in between them. I find it hard to stay invested in the piece when it feels like a lot of the energy gets randomly stifled. I don’t know if this is due to the program or Mahler’s experimentation with creating a world of sound, but in either case, I had some trouble getting past it. That being said, the piece had some really wonderful moments in it. Mahler is really good at writing both soaring, lyrical beauty as well as bombastic and intense climaxes. I quite enjoyed sections of the symphony which made use of choir, calling back to Beethoven’s ninth. A lot of those moments were really beautiful and affecting because the sound is so unexpected and timbrally different from the rest of the orchestra. I’d also like to mention that the recording I watched had Bernstein conducting, and it always amazes me how emotionally involved he gets with the music. It’s really a sight to see! Regarding form, I also found it interesting that the fifth movement was significantly longer than the other four. I’m wondering if this again for programmatic reasons. While what I’ve gathered to be Mahler’s style is still present in this symphony, I’m surprised by how different it is from his first. I’m curious to see if this progression continues as I move through more of his symphonies. Also, the very end of the fifth movement is something else! An addition. Today, I watched a video by David Bruce called The Music That Isn’t Itself, where he discussed programme music in the classical sphere. He mentioned Schumann and Mahler, and how they later removed programmes from their works out of shame. Schumann said something along the lines of Once they eyes is guided, the ear can no longer judge for itself. I thought this view on programmes was really interesting, as for me, the programme often enhances my listening experience. I suppose this comes down to a matter of perception regarding music, and weather one thinks the listener should interpret everything for themselves or if the composer has a duty to guide them on a musical journey. For me personally, I think circumstance is the best judge, but it is an interesting view I had never considered, nonetheless.",
"Suk was a Czech composer and violinist who was active during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. He is known as one of the leading composers of Czech modernism. He studied under Antonin Dvorak, who would become his father in law upon his marriage to Dvorak’s daughter Otilie, and the two formed a close bond. It was the death of both Dvorak and Otilie which inspire Suk to write his Asrael Symphony in 1906. The work is a funeral symphony in five movements, and it is named after the so called Angel of Death from the Old Testament. Suk originally intended for the piece to also be a celebration of Dvorak’s life, but when Otilie died, he abandoned the optimistic tone. This is very evident in the first movement, which almost completely lacking in anything which would infer that type of mood. The entire movement was very dark and dramatic with many moving lines and unexpected shifts in harmony. I really enjoyed the intensity of this movement. The second movement was really good as well. It too was intense, but in a different manner. There were a lot of droning notes and dovetailed lines which, coupled with the unexpected harmonic shifts occurring elsewhere, gave everything a very nebulous sound. I particularly liked the opening figure in the upper strings, which popped up all over the place throughout the movement. The third movement was amazing. It started in simple triple, but a lot of the rhythmic pads served to confuse the meter. The middle section was absolutely gorgeous, then that little opening motif from the second movement made an appearance before bring the movement to a rousing climax. I really enjoyed this movement. The fourth movement was also very enjoyable. On the whole, this movement was more subdued and melodic than the other movements. It still had that underlying intensity, but there was a beauty about it which is hard to explain. You can also tell that Suk is a violinist by looking at his string parts, which tend to be pretty intense yet idiomatic. I love how the last movement kinda just died away into nothing at the end, ending a C minor symphony on a C major chord. Despite the dark nature of almost the entire piece, it ends on a hopeful note, as if writing the music gave Suk his life back. Really an incredible piece of music, and I’m surprised it isn’t more well known.",
"Composed in 1908, this piece (which translates as Song of the Earth) represents a very late addition to Mahler’s output. It was written after a very difficult period of Mahler’s life, where his daughter died, he was forced to reside from his post at the Vienna Court Opera, and he was diagnosed with a congenital heart defect. It is a work of six songs to be sung by aa tenor and alto, with each trading back and forth between movements. Although it is not labeled so, many describe it as being another one of his Symphonies.  The text is a setting of Ancient Chinese poetry translated to German by Hans Bethge. The first movement was really beautiful and seemed to be more akin to his Second Symphony than his First. He really does a lot of experimentation with his harmonies, but he is still melodically very strong. I also enjoyed the momentum this piece managed to maintain, which is something I found to be lacking in his Second Symphony. The Third Movement was really lovely. I really enjoyed the little melody and the relatively simple accompaniment in the orchestra. The whole thing had a very folk tune kind of sound, and I really enjoyed that. The fourth movement also had that kind of a sound, and at times, was reminiscent of a show tune. Movement Five was also like this. Much like in his Second Symphony, the final movement is much longer than the movements before it. In this case, Movement Six accounts for almost half of the piece. I’m curious as to why this might be. Overall, I really enjoyed this piece, and I’m coming to find that Mahler is capable of writing some very diverse music.",
"This is one of Mahler’s most iconic works. It was composed in 1902 and consists of five movements divided into three sections. I really enjoyed the first movement. It had the dramatics of his Second Symphony combined with the momentum of his First. That opening trumpet solo is also very iconic, and I loved how it kept making little appearances throughout the movement. The second movement was really good as well. It had a really nice mix between intense and dramatic scoring and more subdued sections. His brass writing capabilities really shined through on this movement, I thought, and I got chills in more than one place. The ending of the movement I liked especially, as it was a really welcomed contrast from the rest of the movement. I also really liked the little hocket figure he used throughout, where one voice would play an anacrusic phrase of three eighths to a quarter while another voice lept the interval of a ninth from behind it. It gave the idea a sense of depth in space, and putting that behind the main melody added a whole new dimension to the piece. Absolutely wonderful. I also noticed that there were sections where Trumpet I would lean on the lydian #4 of a chord, kinda like John Williams does in the theme for Superman. Given that Mahler’s music sounds very film score-esque at times, I would be curious to know if he had any influence on Williams. The third movement was so good as well! The simple triple feel was a nice relief from the mostly simple quadruple of the previous movements, and the texture of this movement had a tendency to be a bit lighter as well. I really liked how he incorporated glisses into the string melodies at times. I also noticed that this movement had a lot of counterpoint in it, and I really liked the inventiveness of his lines. Mahler also has a tendency of breaking the orchestra down into smaller groups which he messes with for a while before bringing back in the full orchestra. This was evident not only in the third movement, but also the entire fourth movement. The Adagietto is very well known and is often performed as a standalone piece. In it, Mahler only writes for the strings and harp. The movement was incredibly slow, but incredibly beautiful. It leaned into dissonances and resolved them in unexpected and exciting ways. It was slightly reminiscent of Samuel Barber’s Adagio for Strings for these very reasons. Truly a lovely movement. The last movement was a pretty cool little rondo with a lot of rounds a little fugal passages, but I wasn’t a huge fan. Overall a great piece, but in my mind, Mahler’s first still takes the cake!",
"Brahms was a German Romantic Period Composer and Pianist active during the mid to late 1800’s. He is often considered to be one of the Three B’s of music along with Johanne Sebastian Bach and Beethoven. He was a traditionalist in many senses, often studying the counterpoint and forms of those composers long before him, but an innovative vein of Romanticism is said to underlie his music. This is what led to the whole Brahmsian vs. Wagnerian debate, with Brahms being the traditionalist and Wagner being the stark innovator. Brahms’s output was also comparatively small among many composers, as he was an uncompromising perfectionist who often spent years working on a single piece or destroying works which he was unhappy with. His Six Piano Pieces, Opus 118 were completed in 1893 and represent the later period of his compositional output. They were written for and dedicated to his good friend and acclaimed pianist Clara Schumann. His style is very apparent in the First Movement, Intermezzo in Am. His writing is very Beethoven- esque, with lots of doublings at the octave and dramatic, sweeping lines. His sense of counterpoint is very evident in his treatment of consonants and dissonances, and his sense of form is apparent in his repetition of large blocks of material. The Second Movement, Intermezzo in A was absolutely gorgeous. His style again shines through, but one thing I noticed in particular which I found of great interest was some of his phrasing. At time he had a three note figure shifted over the barline by two notes, making the anacrusis on the last beat feel like the first beat of the phrase. He so seamlessly switched into and out of this little technique, and I really liked how it sounded. It gave those sections a subtle sort of momentum, and then when he brings the phrases back to the downbeat, that momentum gives way to the main melody. Really beautiful. I also noticed that a lot of his piano writing thus far sounds a little bit like Chopin, and I’d be curious to know if Brahms cited him as a source of influence. The rest of the pieces had their own character, but most of what I had to say about the first two applies to the rest of them. I really enjoyed this set of pieces, especially the Second Movement, and I’m now curious to check out some of his other works for both piano and larger ensembles.",
"This group was recommended to me by my friend Gerrit, so I decided to check them out. They are an American Bass Clarinet Quartet based out of California which plays original compositions as well as covers of various works. They refer to themselves as heavy chamber music, and often do covers of heavy metal and rock pieces. I found a cover they did of Saint Saens’s Danse Macabre, and since I did a listening log on that piece last semester, I decided it would be cool to check it out. I must say that their arrangement does a really good job of staying true to the original orchestral version. It is clear that they spent a good amount of time analyzing which lines were most important so they wouldn’t be sacrificed in their arrangement. They even managed to replicate the timbres of the various orchestral instruments really well, even despite only having Bass Clarinets to work with! Really an amazing cover, and it definitely makes me want to investigate the Bass Clarinet a bit more, as I hadn’t realized it was such a versatile instrument.",
"John Luther Adams, not to be confused with the California based John Adams, is an Alaskan Composer who is often influenced by natural subjects. He is often considered to be part of the Totalist musical movement of the 80’s and 90’s, which is often seen as developing in reaction to the Minimalist musical movement of the prior few decades. The movement parallels the development of Post- Minimalism in a lot of ways, but often employs greater rhythmic complexity. The goal of the music is to have surface level rhythmic energy with sufficient background complexity, and as such, often has two or more separate/ implied tempos. Adams’s piece Become Ocean was commissioned by the Seattle Symphony Orchestra is 2013 and won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2014. A lot of the ideas behind Totalist music appear to be present in this work, including the idea of rhythmic complexity underpinned by background complexity. To my ears, this more comes across as a wash of timbre which is somewhat reminiscent of Spectralist music (save the fact that it is not electronically manipulated). The influence of Minimalist music is also present, as the piece slowly transitions through areas of high and low energy, as well as different timbral atmospheres. I really enjoyed this piece, and a lot like Glassworks, its something I will probably end up playing in the background as I fall asleep!",
"Glenn Branca was an Avant- Garde American Composer and guitarist who is often placed into the Totalist group as well. He is often associated with the no wave movement, which was a short lived Avant Garde music and arts scene in downtown New York City during the 70’s. This developed in response to New Wave music, and made use of dissonance and repetition to mock punk/ rock genres as well as put forth an often nihilistic message. Branca is known for his use of excessive volume, alternative guitar tunings, repetition, droning and the harmonic series. He also developed a third bridge zither which he dubbed the harmonic guitar. Dr. Jansen gave a presentation on his works today in Composition Forum, and due to his work with Bang on a Can, we actually got to see and hear one of the original harmonic guitars Branca built. The instrument is based on what he called Seven Octave Overtone Tuning, with a 10hz vibration being the lowest fundamental and vibrational modes extending all the way up to 1280 hz. As such, the pitches become closer and closer together as one moves up the instruments range, eventually getting all the way down to sixteenth tones. The timbre of the instrument was really fascinating, as a glass slide placed upon the strings produced a wash of clear and resonant harmonics. It was kind of cool to be in the presence of a somewhat forgotten piece of musical history! The Ascension was Branca’s debut studio album released in 1981. It makes use of alternate tunings for multiple electric guitars, thus reflecting the Totalist and No Wave movements with which he is often concerned. The album sounds to me like a mix between punk rock and minimalist music, which again, perfectly describes the genre it is often associated with. Overall an interesting album with a very interesting history, although I’m not sure its a work I would listen to purely for enjoyment.",
"This is a set of twelve pieces for solo piano written at the tail end of 1909. Book two also comprises twelve preludes, forming a total of twenty four; however, unlike Chopin’s or Bach’s preludes, Debussy did not follow a strict pattern regarding key signature, and a lot of the works are cyclical. I don’t have much to say about the pieces other than that they sound very Debussy. I noticed that he would often have a single melodic, harmonic, or rhythmic idea which he would focus on in each piece, and kind of work around that idea completely. In one of them, he used the whole tone scale for almost the entire piece, simply reharmonizing it in different ways. This tactic interests me, and its something I might give a try in a piece. I also hadn’t realized that Music for a Sunken Cathedral was a prelude, so that was cool to see. Overall, some really unique and interesting piano writing.",
"This piece came to me per recommendation of Mackenzie Brooks, so I decided it was about time to listen to it. Tristan Perich is a living American composer from New York City known for his work with electronic/ fixed media music. His Surface Images was written in 2014, and it is a work for solo piano and forty channel one bit electronics. Right away, I can hear a minimalist influence. I might even venture to say that the piece is at least somewhat spectralist, given the focus on the transformation of timbre and the electronics involved. One really interesting thing I notice about the piece is how the performer keeps time with the electronics. On the recording I’m watching, the pianist appears to have some sort of visual metronome to keep time with the speakers. Really interesting. I also like the use of registral silence. The first six or seven minutes of the piece sees the piano confined to its upper middle register, and when the lower register is finally introduced, it has a really powerful affect. It’s unexpected, which makes it so effective. Registral silence is definitely something I want to work on more within my own music.",
"Julia Wolfe is a living American composer known for her works within the minimalist genre. She is also best known for being one of the founding members of Bang On a Can, along with composers David Lang and Michael Gordon. Their early days featured marathon concerts, where music was played for hours on end and audience members were free to come and go as they please. They also featured works by John Cage, Glenn Branca, and Harry Partch. Her Anthracite Fields is an oratorio for chorus and mixed instruments about the coal mines of her native Pennsylvania hometown. The piece was written in 2014 and received the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2015. The first movement, foundations, is meant to honor all those who lost their lives in coal mines. Initially she was going to list all of the victims, but upon seeing how many people had lost their lives, she shortened the list to include only those with the first name John and a last name with one syllable. The first movement is incredibly heavy and dark, not only in terms of subject matter, but also rhythmically, melodically, and timbrally. Its incredibly haunting when they begin naming all of the Johns, and that is only a fraction of the list. A super effective and creative way to bring attention to a time period and place which is often overlooked. I really enjoyed this piece, and I’m excited to listen to the next movements.",
"This 1997 album is of a Cuban band led by Juan de Marcos González. The group was discovered by Ryan Cooder of World Circuit Records, a music label specializing in Cuban and West African artists. The album was spawned from a renewed interest in the native music of Cuba after its revolutionary phase has passed. Traveling over there, Cooder found a culture rich with unique styles and incredible musicians. This album was the first of a set of three, followed later by The Buena Vista Social Club. This album has received praise from critics and musicians worldwide, and listening to it, I can understand why. From a purely performance, standpoint, the players on this album are incredible. The control and accuracy with which they play their instruments is something to marvel. I also really enjoy the style, which includes things such as bolero, chachachá, salsa, son montuno, timba, guajira, danzón, rumba and abakua. Definitely a really cool album that I could see myself listening to for enjoyment, and I will definitely be checking out the other two albums at some point.",
"This album, released in 1992 after Miles’s death, is his last studio album. The album was produced in conjunction with hip hop producer Easy Mo Bee, and despite being received negatively by critics, it won a Grammy in 1993 for Best R&B Instrumental Performance. The main reason I wanted to listen to this album is because I was told it represents a completely different side of Miles than what is seen in his works from the 50’s and 60’s (which consisted largely of pretty straight forward jazz). Right away the difference in style is very apparent in this album. It’s essentially Miles improvising over hip hop grooves. I can understand why critics used to expecting certain things from Miles might have viewed this album through a negative lense, but I myself don’t mind it too much. I’m a big fan of Miles’s straight forward jazz, but its kind of cool to hear him mix things together with another genre. The juxtaposition of the two genres has a really interesting sound, and I kinda dig it. This is definitely something I can see growing on me given some time, and I might listen to this casually.",
"This album, released in 1970, is yet another continuation in Miles’s experimentation. The album makes use of an unusually large rhythm section, including two bassists, two keyboardists, and two to three drummers, and has slow moving harmonies which create a sonic atmosphere perfect for improvisation. The album cusps the border of free jazz, and it had immense influence on jazz rock and funk. The piece also had some very well known personnel, including Joe Zawinul and Chick Corea on keys. The album was also innovative from a studio use perspective, using techniques such as tape loops, tape delays, reverb chambers and echo effects. This makes sense, as the albums producer Teo Macero (also the producer of Kind of Blue) was heavily influenced by the French idea of  musique concrète, which utilized recorded sounds as raw compositional material. The album sounds very heavy compared to some of Miles’s other works both from a harmonic, instrumental, and improvisatory perspective. It has a sort of underlying intensity about it which is almost unsettling at times. I think the thing most interesting about the album is that I can still tell its Miles, even despite the fact that it is so radically different from the things he was doing before. An interesting work that I would like to devote more time to in the future.",
"Diz was an American trumpeter, composer, bandleader, and singer. In the 1940’s he became a huge figure in the development of Bebop, and his puffed cheeks, bent horn, and scat singing became prominent symbols of the genre. Free Ride was released in 1977 in collaboration with Lalo Schifrin, and Argentinian Composer best known for writing the theme to Mission Impossible. The album is a bit later in Dizzy’s career, and thus represents his movement away from the world of BebOpus  The first track in particular, Unicorn, has a particularly funky sound. The straight eights and syncopated bass line along with the synths, guitar comping, and drumming style all point to a Funk influence. The tune totally slaps. Overall I really liked the album, and I’m going to investigate Dizzy a bit further in the future. Side note, all the compositions on the album are by Lalo Schifrin. I want to give credit where it is due!",
"Funny story on this one. I’ve always really enjoyed this arrangement of September by Earth Wind and Fire. Last week, after I talked with Dr. Smith about Edmund Welles, he suggested that I check out Michael Lowenstern. I read that he was an American Bass Clarinetist and composer based out of Brooklyn New York. When I searched for him on YouTube, the channel Earspasm Music popped up (the same channel that had the arrangement of September). After digging a bit, I learned that Earspasm is in fact Michael Lowenstern! The world is such a small place sometimes. Anyways, the arrangement is fantastic. It again shows how versatile the Bass Clarinet is, which is something I hadn’t really realized before now. Super interesting stuff!",
"The second movement of Anthracite Fields, dedicated to the Breaker Boys who removed coal from the coal breakers (a machine which breaks coal down into smaller, more useful pieces). This movement makes use of a lot of percussion, almost giving the impression of machinery. There is one section where the voices begin listing off ages, assumed to be ages where children were killed in work related accidents. Like the naming of the Johns in the previous movement, this is incredibly haunting and effective. She even used what sounded like bicycle chains at the end. I really liked this movement.",
"This movement uses a speech given by John L. Lewis about safer working conditions as text. The text is incredibly haunting for apparent reasons, and I find her syllabic setting of it to be very fitting. This is probably my favorite movement so far.",
"This movement is based around an interview conducted with the daughter and granddaughter of coal miners. I would imagine that the flowers are representative of those people in our lives, or gardens. Chanting the names of various flowers, to me at least, is symbolic of all the different kinds of people who were lost. The end of the movement has the voices naming the flower Myosotis, commonly known as forget-me-nots. The repetition of this phrase takes on double meaning, both as a flower and as a call to not forget those lives lost. This explains why, on the album cover for Anthracite Fields, there are clusters of Myosotis growing amongst the field of coal.",
"The final movement of this work takes its text from a coal advertisement which touches upon the importance of fuel powering our nation. This almost makes me think that Julia Wolfe isn’t bitter over the events which transpired, but is rather trying to bring to light the sacrifices which those people made. Overall, the whole piece was really good. I think its fascinating how Julia took an idea and turned it into something so powerful and affecting, even for the people whose lives weren’t directly impacted by those losses. Really interesting, and it makes me want to take a seemingly random idea and turn it into something beautiful. Small Addition: I watched a video called The Making of Anthracite Fields. It was interesting to see behind the scenes of not only the composition of the piece, but also the world premiere. There was a surprising amount of theatrics/ choreography involved, and I found that to be interesting. They created not only an enveloping sonic environment, but also a visually stimulating performance as well. Very cool and interesting.",
"An interesting piece at the Student Composers Concert tonight! Tom Johnson is an American minimalist composer. His music often focuses on logical mathematical sequences, as is the case with this piece. The piece is based on a mathematical formula developed in 14th century India. It states that a single cow produces one calf in a year, and by the fourth year of its existence, each calf begins producing a calf. The question asks how many cows are in the herd at every nth year. Johnson’s piece is a musical representation of this problem, taking the listener through seventeen years of cow breeding. Each cow is represented by a musical impulse, and a certain pitch is assigned to each generation. A narrator explains what is happening in between each year, and the performance ends at the seventeenth year. I thought this piece was really interesting both in its use of a narrator as well as its rich musical atmosphere based in simple mathematics. Really wonderful.",
"Time for some more Chopin. Last semester I did his preludes, and since Noah did this piece so wonderfully on his Senior Performance Recital today, I thought I would enter it into my listening log. Chopin’s Ballades, of which there are four, are often considered to be amongst the most challenging of pieces in the standard piano repertoire. Composed between 1842, the fourth and final Ballade is dedicated to Baroness Rothschild, a member of the prominent Rothschild banking family in France. This Ballade in particular is known for its difficulty technically and musically, as well as its extended use of counterpoint, its unrelenting coda, and the mirror form of the recapitulation (the piece is largely sonata- allegro with a little bit of variation form mixed in, but during the recapitulation, the themes are presented in reverse order). It really is just a really incredibly powerful and beautiful piece of music. The technical skill required to play it simply astounds me, and to think that Chopin actually wrote it. Really just incredible. There’s one part in particular towards the middle section that I really liked. Harmonically he is moving the fifth of a Db major triad up chromatically (line cliche), but as if that wasn’t enough, he arpeggiated that movement across the entire range of the keyboard. Its really just amazing, since he used that same line cliche earlier in the movement. I really loved this piece, Noah’s performance damn near brought me to tears, and I will definitely be checking out the rest of his Ballades in more detail.",
"Another throwback to last semester when I listened to his fifth symphony. I really loved that piece, and since I again heard this piece played in Area by Caroline, I decided to put it into my listening log. I couldn’t find a ton of info on this piece in specific other than that it was composed in 1903 and was part of a set of ten pieces for piaNumber I don’t have much to say about the piece other than it is is really beautiful. Some of the thick chord voicings high in the register of the piano give me a bit of a Debussy vibe, almost like Music for a Sunken Cathedral at times. Really gorgeous. I still want to look into more Sibelius some time soon.",
"Samuel Barber was an American Composer active during the 20th century. He is best known for his Adagio for Strings, but he also won the Pulitzer Prize of Music for his opera Vanessa as well as his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. His Hermit Songs, composed in 1953, is a cycle of ten songs for high voice and piaNumber The text is translations of anonymous poems by Irish Monks between the 8th and 13th centuries. We listened to the second one, Church Bells at Night during beginning composition, so I thought I would listen to the other ones as well. They were cool pieces. I recognized a couple of them from Voice Rec Sems.",
"Time for some more Crumb. I listened to Lux Aeterna early this semester, and during my research I found Black Angels to be his most well- known piece. Noah also suggested that I listen to it, so here I am! The piece is subtitled as Thirteen Images from the Dark Land, and its instrumentation is for electric strings and other various instruments. The work was composed in 1970 in tempore belli, or during time of war. The piece is written as a threnody for the Vietnam War which was raging during the pieces composition. The form of the piece is arch like with many palindromes and references to the numbers thirteen and seven, often viewed as numbers relating to fate or destiny. The thirteen movements are broken down into three sections which follow the journey of a soul; Departure (fall from grace), Absence (spiritual annihilation) and Return (redemption). It’s also worth mentioning that this piece’s influence is vast; the Kronos Quartet formed after David Harrington heard the piece over the radio, David Bowie listed the piece as one of his top twenty five favorite albums, and the opening movement is featured on the soundtrack to the movie The Exorcist. I recognized the sound right away, as The Exorcist is one of my favorite movies. Such an unsettling sound. The overarching thing I’ve really taken away from this piece is just how much he messed around with timbre/ creating different sound worlds. It’s amazing the different kinds of sounds he managed to produce using just string instruments and extended techniques. One other thing I noticed he did was he would have something somewhat tonal and traditional juxtaposed against something otherwise. It reminded me a lot of Charles Ives’s The Unanswered Question, where for the majority of the piece, the string played a chorale like texture underneath the chaos of the winds, almost like textural planing. I really like this effect, and its something I am going to explore further. Overall a pretty cool piece.",
"This album comes was recommended to me by Andy, and since I’m not to familiar with Chick’s work, it seemed like a good opportunity to enter into my log. Chick is an American jazz pianist and composer. He was with Miles’s groups in the late 60’s and helped to develop Jazz Fusion. He also developed the fusion band Return to Forever. He has been described as one of the leading voices of jazz piano in the post- Coltrane era. Light as a Feather, released in 1973, is the second studio album of Return to Forever, and it continues to push forward the genre of jazz fusion. The last track is Spain, which is one of his best known works and a jazz standard. I can’t believe I’ve never listened to this album before, its so good! To my ears, it has the drive of straight ahead jazz of the 50’s, the innovative sound of 70’s jazz, and the subtlety of Bossa Nova. Spain is such a cool piece, especially the flute a vocals playing along with Chick on the piaNumber I’m really blown away by this album, and I’m definitely going to be listening to it more often!",
"Mingus was an American jazz double bassist and composer. He is considered to be one of the most influential jazz musicians of all time, and much of his work, including this album, has been entered into the Library of Congress for its cultural significance. He is also well known for his sporadic and short temper, as well as his periods of depression and decreased productivity. Mingus Ah Um, released in 1959 (the same year as Kind of Blue, Time Out, and Giant Steps), it features some of his best known works. Overall it was a pretty cool album. Pretty straight forward jazz, but it was still a good listen. As usual, I’m going to want to check out more of his stuff.",
"Mahler’s sixth is a four movement symphony composed in 1904. It is nicknamed Tragic due to its dark character and suddenly shifting moods, although it was written during a period of relative happiness during Mahler’s life. The fourth movement also contains the famous Mahler Hammer. I really enjoyed the first movement. It had some really catchy melodies and super powerful/ exciting moments. It appeared to be in Sonata form, with a repeated exposition. A lot of the movement also sounded like a march due to its rhythms and prominent percussion parts. About halfway through the movement, there was a moment which reminded me a ton of Beethoven’s seventh movement two. It had an A major chord turning to an A minor chord and some scoring for upper winds. I probably also made this association since they are in the same key. The percussion of this movement also stuck out to me in certain parts. There was one point where he seemed to notate an improvisatory section for the auxiliary percussion, and this created a really unique and unexpected sonic atmosphere. I really liked how that sounded. The second movement was pretty wild. The mood of the piece changed very rapidly, witching from frantic and desperate to calm a serene in the flip of a witch. Those march rhythms from the first movement carried over into this movement, but in more of a duple feel. Metrically this movement was really interesting, switching a lot between 3/8, 2/8, 4/4, 23/4, and 4/4. Even looking at the score it was difficult to tell where the downbeat was. My guess is that he did this to make the shifts in mood more unexpected and surprising, matching the character of the movement as a whole. It was definitely a cool movement. The second movement was absolutely beautiful, and I don’t have much more to say about it other than that. Just absolutely breathtaking. The fourth movement is pretty awesome. Its again the longest movement of the symphony by a significant margin, which is a trend I’m beginning to notice with Mahler. At the 1:05:10 mark or so, I swear I can hear a reference to the opening trumpet solo of Mahler Five but in a major key. Mahler did say, My Sixth will propound riddles the solution of which may be attempted only by a generation which has absorbed and truly digested my first five symphonies, so I’m wondering if this is one of those riddles which will only be attempted after digesting the prior five symphonies. The ending of the movement was really unique. It slowly came down to only a couple instruments playing piano, then there was a tutti fortissimo chord out of nowhere, before finally ending with pizzicato strings at piaNumber Overall a really cool symphony. I liked it almost as much as Mahler one, but not quite!",
"The Youngblood Brass Band is a brass band from Oregon, Wisconsin. It was formed by students at Oregon High School in 1996, and since has picked up speed. They tour pretty frequently and have released quite a few albums. They sought to combine elements of jazz, punk, and hip- hop, often rapping over tracks. Since they didn’t fit into any tradition genre, they coined the term Riot Jazz. I’m curious to see if any of their stuff sounds like Miles Davis Doo Bop, since it was released only four years before they formed and also features jazz elements combined with hip- hop elements. Brooklyn was recommended to me by Collin, and the Trombone Choir also did an arrangement of it last night, so it works out well. This piece slaps pretty hard. I can definitely hear a hip- hop sort of influence in the rhythms, although its quite different from Doo BOpus  Similar, but Mile’s more improvised over hip- hop tracks than what they did, which is more akin to hip- hop written for brass band. They are also pretty amazing performers. They have pretty exceptional range and control over that range, and they are right in the pocket the whole time. The tuba player is also worth pointing out, as he is doing some pretty crazy stuff! It makes me wonder if these guys went to college for their instruments, since they formed the group in high school. They certainly sound like trained musicians, but I would still be interested. It’s kind of an irrelevant detail given their level of skill, but music academia can sometimes have an elitist aura, and I’m curious to know if they play without that influence. In either case, it’s a pretty great piece, and I’m definitely interested in hearing more of their stuff or seeing them live.",
"Mark Applebaum is a living American composer and professor at Stanford University. He is a highly sought after composer of new music and has been commissioned by well known groups all around the world. His compositions range from tape pieces to full orchestral works, and his music is known for having improvisational and whimsical elements. Precomposition, released in 2003, is a piece for one channel eight bit electronics. We listened to it today during comp forum following a very interesting, fun, and inspiring lecture, and I liked it so much that I decided to put it in here. The piece is supposed to depict the act of composition, with each speaker representing a different voice of the composition process. The piece, in my opinion, very accurately depicts how it can sometimes feel to compose. Even despite its satirical nature, I feel as though I can relate on some level to the various voices represented in the piece. Idealist, Realist, Pessimist, Optimist, Logic, Spirituality, et cetera Its interesting to hear all of these different personality types interact in a palpable way, and as I write, I can definitely relate to trying to reconcile the views of all of these different perspectives whilst trying to write. Granted, this is something I am still working on doing, but this piece actually gives me some ideas about how to approach the issue. I might try actually giving all of my perspectives a literal voice, and almost like mediating a debate, see if I can get them to compromise on creative decisions. I’m certain I will look like a lunatic while doing this, but luckily, no one watches me compose! In either case, a really unique, funny, and thought provoking piece. Side note: I watched a Ted Talk he did, and it was really interesting. He talked about the various roles he often end up finding himself in as a result of his creative process, and took some time to explore examples of each of those roles. A lot of what he did extended past the creation of music and into the worlds of visual arts, choreography, and invention. At the end he proposed the question Is this music, and responded with It doesn’t matter. The right question is, is it interesting? I found this to be very intriguing. He doesn’t confine his creativity to the world of music, but rather goes wherever he finds interest. This helps to explain some of the things that not only he does, but also potentially what others do. Very interesting presentation.",
"Some more Strauss, this piece composed in 1915 after Also Sprach Zarathustra. It’s more a tone poem than a symphony, as it depicts a group of hikers getting lost on an Alpine mountain during a storm. The piece is in twenty two sections and is one of Strauss’s largest works, calling for around 125 players. This was Strauss’s last Symphonic Work, and at its dress rehearsal, he proclaimed that he had finally learned to orchestrate. The piece was also the first to be compressed onto a compact disc. It was a pretty intense piece of music. Much like Also Sprach Zarathustra, it was really good at exploring the various timbres of the orchestra and thus taking the listener on a journey through the mountains. Instrumentally, the orchestra was massive. I noticed that he scored for eight (8!) horns, which is pretty nuts. There was also a wind machine, which was a super cool and unexpected sound during the storm movement. I was scratching my head when I first heard it, but then I found it in the score and realized it was a specialty instrument. Overall a really cool piece with a lot to listen to. I’m sure one could spend a lifetime analyzing all the various aspects of its composition, so I’m not going to even try. All I can say is Bravo, Strauss. Bravo.",
"The second to last of Mahler’s symphonies and the last of his works to be premiered during his lifetime. It was composed in 1906 in a single inspired burst during the summer, which was unusual for Mahler. It is one of the largest works in the classical concert repertoire, employing a massive orchestra and multiple choirs. The piece marks the end of his middle period and a return to his earlier period, where he sought to combine vocal and instrumental forces. The work is often compared to Beethoven’s Ninth for obvious reasons. The symphony is written in two parts with text from a 9th century Latin Christian Hymn for Pentecost and the closing scene of Goethes Faust. The two settings are united by the idea of redemption through love, representing Mahler’s abandonment of his previously nihilistic outlook. The whole symphony is very Mahler. It’s very intense most of the time, but it is also interspersed with periods of serene beauty. This is more evident in the second section, which is why I think I liked that section more. The first section was cool, but it was really intense almost the entire time, and I felt as though I didn’t ever get a chance to catch my breath. That might be a personal preference, but in any case I thought the second section was better. Its also worth mentioning that the second section is programmatic in nature, which has an influence on the kinds of textures used. I think that this difference in the first and second section is really evident, and I like the idea of uniting two seemingly disparate sections under a common thematic idea. This idea isn’t necessarily outwardly evident, especially because I don’t speak Latin or German, but a lot of things in art and music arent outwardly evident. Some artistic works are more rewarding to those who understand the process/ context behind them, as we saw Babbitt quote last night in comp forum. Granted he was speaking to a different degree, there is still overlap. Everything we do as people is informed by those who came before us, and if we didnt understand anything those people did to some degree, it would be impossible to enjoy anything. Anyways, I digress. The symphony is certainly a spectacle to hear, and even the score is monstrous. I’m sure it is an incredible experience to hear live.",
"Liszt was a Hungarian composer, virtuoso pianist, conductor, music teacher, arranger and organist of the Romantic era for most of the 19th century. Although Hungarian, he is often associated with German Romanticism. Given his progressive and often programmatic style, he is often sided with Wagner and against Brahms in the so called War of the Romantics. This wasn’t an actual war, nor was there any bad blood between the composers, but the two sides moved in different directions musically. Liszt was best known for being a virtuosic piano player, as he was inspired at a young age by Paganini to become so. The core of his repertoire was his own compositions as well as arrangement of other popular pieces, which is why Liszt arrangements/ transcriptions are often seen in the piano repertoire. He is also known for coining the term Symphonic Poem. His Hungarian Rhapsodies are a set of nineteen Hungarian Rhapsodies for piano, the second of which, composed in 1847, is by far the most well- known. It follows the structure of a traditional Hungarian Dance, with a slower lassan section and a faster friska sections. The virtuosic style and his talent as a pianist and composer alike are clearly evident in this piece. I really liked the sharp contrast drawn between the two sections. Super cool, and Valentina Lisitsa is insane.",
"My friend Shane recommended this piece to me after we finished a discussion about Hitler’s artwork. Charles Manson was an American criminal, cultist, and musician. He knew Dennis Wilson, a founding member of the Beach Boys, and they recorded one of his songs Cease to Exist (retitled Never Learn Not to Love) without crediting him. He formed a cult in mid- 1967 called the Manson Family, which had about 100 members which used hallucinogens habitually. The cult killed nine people under Manson’s instruction (he thought the murders were helping precipitate an impending race war as described by the piece Helter Skelter from the Beatles White Album), and he was committed to prison where he died in 2017. The piece I’m listening to is the fourth track of his debut album, which was recorded before the murders and released before his conviction. I think what is so striking about the song is the lyrics. Even though he had schizophrenia and paranoid delusional disorder, there is something weirdly truthful about his lyrics. At least to me, they come across as criticizing the pretentious nature of materialism and the flaws of a philosophy which assumes conformity and instant gratification. Like the music of Carlos Gesualdo, there is something haunting, yet oddly relatable about the music:",
"Frank Sinatra was an American singer, actor, and producer who was one of the most popular and influential musical artists of the 20th century (many even argue that he was the first American Superstar). His career spanned most of the 20th century, and he made his start during the swing era with bandleaders such as Tommy Dorsey. In researching him, I’ve noticed something rather interesting about him which is different from a lot of the other people on my list. He is not a composer, but rather a performer, even despite his massive number of albums. Rather, he did performances of popular standards or had composers write music for him. Sinatra was the face of the music, much like what is so ubiquitous in the modern music industry, and I’m guessing that is at least part of the reason his name has retained such an elevated status even years after he died. Such was the case with his album Frank Sinatra Sings for Only the Lonely, released in 1958. The album is filled with torch songs, which are love songs in which the other party is unaware of the love which the singer feels for them. Only the Lonely is the eponymous first track, and it was written by Sammy Cahn and Jimmy van Heusen. Cahn was an American lyricist, songwriter, and musician best known for his works Come Fly With Me and Let it Snow. Van Heusen, another American composer, was born right down the road in Syracuse and is best known for his piece Swinging on a Star. I really enjoyed this piece. It’s really easy to listen to in the sense that it isn’t too complex texturally, harmonically, or melodically, and Sinatra’s declaration of the lyrics is really clear. It almost sounds like the music of the crooners, although Sinatra and Bing did not identify with that label. In any case, a really lovely piece of music, and when I think about the other pieces written by Cahn and Van Heusen, I can definitely hear the relationship. It’s also worth mentioning that Nelson Riddle was the arranger and conductor for the album, and he worked with other artists such as Ella Fitzgerald, Nat King Cole, Judy Garland, Dean Martin, and Peggy Lee through Capitol Records.",
"I’ve been on a big Genesis kick lately, so I’ve decided to listen to a few of their albums which I haven’t heard. From Genesis to Revelation, released in 1969, is their debut album. It was a commercial flop, receiving mixed to negative reviews, and it only sold 650 copies. The band temporarily disbanded after the album to continue their education before reforming again in 1970 to record Trespass. It’s also worth mentioning that this album was recorded before Phil Collins joined the group. The album was also recorded when they were right out of high school at eighteen or nineteen years old, which definitely makes me view it through a different lense. I find it interesting that the band was often embarrassed of this album, as people are often very critical of their early works. In general, the album is much more straightforward than anything else I’ve heard by Genesis. The meter is pretty consistent, its more harmonically grounded in a tonal world, and while there is some experimentation with instrumentation and timbre, its much more mild than their later adventures in that realm. It certainly isn’t bad, but it is very different. I can still tell that it is Genesis, but they are still finding their characteristic style. Overall a pretty cool listen, although I still prefer their later stuff.",
"I couldn’t find a lot of info on this band other than the names of their band members. In fact, I don’t even remember who recommended me this piece, so its kind of just here without much explanation. The tune is pretty cool and the group is really tight, so I can understand why it was recommended to me. I will definitely be keeping my eyes open for this group as I go forward, and I subscribed to their YouTube channel so I can hopefully hear more of their stuff as it gets released.",
"Some more Liszt. Since I had read that he was a pioneer of the symphonic poem form, I decided to investigate one of them. Composed in 1850, Prometheus is the fifth in his cycle of thirteen poems. He wanted to expand the traditional single- movement forms beyond the classical overture, stating, New wine demands new bottles. As such, he broke the rules of classical form and introduced his own episodic approach which revolved around the motivic and thematic transformation that Wagner would later make famous. In the midst of the so- called War of the Romantics, Liszt appeared amongst the most liberal of them all. The work is based on the Greek myth detailing the Titan Prometheus theft of fire from the gods. The work was originally composed as an overture to Johann Gottfried Herders Der entfesselte Prometheus. Joachim Raff produced the first score from Liszt’s notes, and when Liszt revised the piece in 1855, the overture expanded into the independent symphonic poem. The piece also gained fame thanks to the many performances of it by Hans von Bulow, who was a well- known conductor responsible for establishing the successes of several major composers of the time, especially Richard Wagner and Johannes Brahms. He was also an early student of Liszt, and eventually married his daughter Cosima (who later left him for Wagner). What a small world. I must say that this is one of my favorite works that I’ve listened to so far this semester. It definitely has the German Romanticist sound, and in all the right ways. Unlike the Mahler Symphonies, it provides plenty of opportunity to catch one’s breath and break from the characteristic intensity. I’m not saying that Mahler didn’t have balance in his music, but sometimes his moments of intensity felt long winded and unending. Harmonically and melodically, it has the gusto and dramatism of Beethoven, and the motivic development of Wagner (the chicken came before the egg in this case, but I’m still drawing the parallel). A really cool and exciting piece that I already find myself wanting to listen to again! I ended up listening to it again right after writing this.",
"This is the sixth studio album by Genesis and the last one with Peter Gabriel in the group. It is a concept album which follows the journey of self-discovery of Rael, a Puerto Rican youth living in New York City and the bizarre incidents and characters he meets along the way. The plot summary is truly fantastical, and much of it is metaphorical for the various topical issues Rael would have been experiencing at the time. It was released as a double album, as Genesis was certain their fans would be willing to commit the time to listening to it after the immense success of Selling England By the Pound. This album was written during a tough time for Genesis, as everyone’s lives were moving in different directions. Tensions were particularly high with Gabriel, as he was working with William Friedkin on the side yet still insisted upon writing all of the lyrics. The personnel of this album are Gabriel, Collins, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford, and Tony Banks. I loved the first track. Just a really catchy and cool piece of music, and I like it melded into the next song. In fact, a lot of the tracks seem to meld into one another like one giant piece of music. This would make sense for a concept album, since it is just telling one giant story. In Cuckoo Cocoon, the timbre of Peter’s voice is modified to reflect the change of environment. Counting Out Time was lyrically entertaining, and Carpet Crawlers is really beautiful. It seems as though the whole story, even through its fantastical elements, is a massive metaphor for Rael discovering himself and defining his morals. At the end of the story, instead of crossing the portal back into the real world, he chooses to save his Brother John. He then sees his own face in gis brothers, implying that he saved himself. I think the lyrics of the final song best sum up the main theme of the story. Rael saved himself after being forced to truly look at himself, and he is suggesting the same for anyone else. A super cool album!",
"Premiered in 1857, this is a three movement piece about Goethe’s Faust. It is not a traditional symphony, and is more akin to his symphonic poems. Each movement is a character piece of the three main protagonists in Faust (Faust, Gretchen, Mephistopheles). Liszt was very against writing anything about Faust, but he encountered it at every corner during his residency at Weimar (including Berlioz’s and Schumanns pieces). He finally caved and wrote a piece for the unveiling of a monument for Goethe and Schiller (another writer of Weimar Classicism). Von Bulow conducted the premiere, although he later stated his passionate disgust of the piece. It wasn’t until years later that the work once again started making appearances on concert programs. I really can’t relate to Bulow’s opinions of the piece. Much like Prometheus, I really enjoyed this piece. Just the right mixture of everything, in my opinion. A very cool piece of music.",
"I’m currently reading a book called The Song Machine: Inside the Hit Factory by John Seabrook, which basically traces the evolution of pop into the machine it is today. The story, Mr. Seabrook asserts, begins with Denniz PoP, a Swedish Producer and predecessor of Max Martin, who first began playing with the idea of producing music in a manufactured sort of way and got the ball rolling for Swedish songwriters and producers. Ace of Base sent him a demo CD which got stuck in the player of his car, and after listening to the song Mr. Ace for weeks on end, he decided to produce them. He modified the piece a bit, renamed it All That She Wants, and thus began the popularity of Ace of Base (Clive Davis, an American record producer, soon brought it to the states where it quickly gained traction as well). One of the things that Denniz sought to do when designing hits was to combine the rhythmic backbeat of the dance music he DJed with the melodic strength often seen in popular music. This piece clearly does this, as the melody is fairly distinguishable and catchy, and the rhythmic backbeat is very prominent and strong. I really don’t like the song (I find that it lacks a lot of substance), but I can definitely see how it became a hit within the general populous. I hope to continue tracing the music in this book as I move forward.",
"Another Ace of Base Piece off the same album as All That She Wants. It too received immense popularity upon its release. The same type of sound is evident in this piece, with a strong rhythmic backbone and a cathy, well defined melody. I again don’t like the piece, but I can certainly see how it gained such acclaim within the general populous.",
"This piece was recommended to me by Mackenzie, and she also transcribed it and played it on her Junior Recital. Ellington was an  American composer, pianist, and leader of a jazz orchestra, which he led from 1923 until his death over a career spanning more than fifty years. He wrote thousands of pieces of music, with a handful becoming standards. His orchestra consisted of some of the best players of the time, and many stayed with the group for decades. Mary Lou Williams was also an arranger for his group, and I listened to her piece Black Christ of the Andes last semester. At the end of the WWII, the cost of hiring big bands increased significantly, and Ellington’s career reached a low point. It wasn’t until his appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival in 1956 that his career saw a revival. Not much info is available about Magenta Haze other than that it exists and he wrote it. The piece has the classic ‘20s big band sound I tend to like. A really pretty piece, and I will definitely be investigating Duke further.",
"Jake Heggie is an American composer of Opera and art songs, including Dead Man Walking, Great Scott, and Moby Dick. I had the privilege of meeting him this week during his residency here, and not only was he a wonderful and funny human being with an amazing Cartman impression, but also an incredibly skilled and knowledgeable composer. Friendly Persuasions is a cycle of four songs in homage to Francis Poulenc, a member of Les Six and an idol of Heggie’s. I go to here the third movement in person last night, and it moved me so much that I decided to check out the whole cycle. Movement I, Wanda Landowska, is based on the Polish- French harpsichordist of the same name. Poulenc wrote a harpsichord concerto for her, and the piece seems to depict a frantic conversation they had regarding the work. Movement II, Pierre Bernac, is named after the French Baritone who had a close association with Poulenc. In fact, Poulenc wrote the majority of his songs for Bernac. This movement seems to be depicting a conversation they had about one of those pieces, with Poulenc throwing it onto the fire in disgust and Bernac watching on in shock. Movement III, Raymonde Linossier, is based on his childhood friend of the same name. She introduced him to much of the literature of the time and had an active involvement with his musical ventures for most of his life. Poulenc actually proposed to her out of convenience in an attempt to hide his homosexualtiy, but she rejected him and he went into a deep depression for nearly a year. She died unexpectedly in 1930 before the conflict was resolved, and this piece seems to be about that grief. It is really a beautiful and heartbreaking piece of music, especially the first lyric. Honestly one of my favorite pieces I’ve listened to this semester, right up there with Prometheus. Movement IV, Paul Eluard, is named after a French Poet and author who was one of the founders of the Surrealist movement. The two were good friends, and Poulenc actually set some of his poetry to music (which I will definitely be checking out). The piece seems to be about WWII, as Eluard served on the frontlines, where he was given a chair, a desk and a pen to painfully write to the families of the dead and the wounded. He wrote more than 150 letters a day. At night he dug graves to bury the dead. An amazing song cycle that I wish was more well known.",
"Finally one of Brahms’s Symphonies! I’ve always heard that these are wonderful, and I’m glad to finally be checking them out. His first symphony took him over fourteen years to complete. This was in part due to his uncompromising perfectionism, but also because his friends and the general public had expected him to carry forth Beethoven’s legacy. Brahms saw this as a significant challenge, and thus spent a significant amount of time attempting to meet that expectation. It is for this reason that much of the symphony supposedly sounds like Beethoven’s Ninth, so I will definitely be keeping my ears open for that. The symphony is largely in C minor and consists of four movements. Right away, the first movement sounds a lot like Beethoven. The way he writes for the upper winds screams Beethoven at times. I can’t describe exactly what he does that is so distinct, but maybe Dr. Smith can shed some light on that for me. He also has a tendency of building to a climax, and then quickly dropping away the instrumentation to a few instruments playing quietly. Very Beethoven. This might be a bit of a stretch, but he did use that motif from Beethoven Five Movement I. Granted he is in 6/8 and it’s a pretty common rhythm, but something about his usage of it and its appearance all over the place makes it feel a bit like a quote. He at times offset the phrase by a beat to obscure the meter before realigning it on the downbeat.  I also really liked how the ending of this movement kind of just died away to nothing. The second movement was lovely, as was movement three. The fourth movement was also very Beethoven, especially the primary theme. I can definitely see why Brahms was considered a traditionalist. Granted this is his first symphony, and comparing Beethoven’s first symphony to his last shows great change, it still rests as sounding like a continuation of Beethoven’s work. This is what Brahms was going for and he accomplished it. I’d be curious to hear his later symphonies and compare.",
"This work, translated as Clearings in the Sky, is a set of thirteen melodies on poems by Francis Jammes, a French poet, novelist and playwright. They were written in 1914 for high voice and piaNumber Just a series of lovely songs. They give me some ideas about home I can possibly diversify my piano textures, so I will definitely be exploring some of the techniques present a bit further.",
"Composed in 1884, this is the last of Brahms’s Symphonies. It is scored for an orchestra smaller than that of his first, and it consists of four movements. I really enjoyed the first movement. I can still hear a bit of the Beethoven influence that one would expect, but it sounds a bit more romantic to my ears. Some of the harmonies he used (such as the Augmaj7) and his scoring for the strings and winds only serve to support my claim. The second movement was incredibly beautiful. It was a really slow 6/8 which felt sort of suspended in midair the whole time. Really beautiful with a few motifs that will be stuck in my head all weekend. The third movement as well! I feel like I’ve heard this somewhere, but I can’t quite place my finger on it. Super catchy and fun! Last movement was great. I liked this Symphony a lot, even more than his first.",
"Premiered in 1854, this piece is the third in the set of thirteen symphonic poems by Liszt. The piece was originally conceived as an overture to his Les quatres éléments, a cycle of four choral pieces to text by the French poet Joseph Autran. He later removed any connection to this piece from the score and added his own programme, stating in the preface: What else is our life but a series of preludes to that unknown Hymn, the first and solemn note of which is intoned by Death?—Love is the glowing dawn of all existence; but what is the fate where the first delights of happiness are not interrupted by some storm, the mortal blast of which dissipates its fine illusions, the fatal lightning of which consumes its altar; and where is the cruelly wounded soul which, on issuing from one of these tempests, does not endeavour to rest his recollection in the calm serenity of life in the fields? Nevertheless man hardly gives himself up for long to the enjoyment of the beneficent stillness which at first he has shared in Natures bosom, and when the trumpet sounds the alarm, he hastens, to the dangerous post, whatever the war may be, which calls him to its ranks, in order at last to recover in the combat full consciousness of himself and entire possession of his energy. This was also the first piece to be advertised as a symphonic poem, thus birthing the term. This piece is also performed at the end of each Interlochen summer camp by the large ensembles. The piece is composed of five sections, including Question, Love, Storm, Bucolic Clam, and Battle and Victory. What an awesome piece of music all around. I liked it even more than Prometheus. Same stuff to say, just to a higher degree. I think Dr. Smith might be starting to get some insight into my musical tastes!",
"I decided to give these a listen since they were connected to Heggie’s Friendly Persuasions. Poulenc was a French composer and pianist who, along with Germaine Tailleferre and others, was part of Les Six. He was well known amongst famous composers of the time, including Stravinsky, and a dichotomy of devout Catholic and uncontrollable sensuality is often seen in his body of work. This piece, composed in 1935, is a setting of poems by Paul Eluard, a French poet and one of the founders of the surrealist movement. It sounds not at all like how I had expected, given the neoclassical style of Les Six. This music sounded much less grounded melodically and harmonically, possibly reflecting the surrealist nature of Eluards work. A pretty interesting work.",
"This piece came up as a recommendation from JJay Berthume, a music channel I watch on YouTube. He said it reminded him of Become Ocean by John Luther Adams, and since I listened to that piece earlier this semester, I decided to give the piece a listen. Eric Whitacre is a well known American composer of choral, orchestral, and wind band music. He, along with Morten Lauridsen, have been described as neo- impressionist. He is also well known for his virtual choirs, where he combines videos of people from all over the world singing his pieces into one eclectic chorus. The piece was composed in 2015 for orchestra, and it is inspired by the Hubble Deep Field Image. The piece also features Virtual Choir Five, and audience members can download an app which plays electronica when the conductor cues them in. I can definitely understand the comparison to Become Ocean, and while I’ve only played a couple of Lauridsen’s pieces, I an understand that parallel as well. The piece is lacking strong melodic and harmonic content, but rather focuses on the various timbres and textures within the ensemble, creating a sonic environment which slowly shifts the listeners focus to various parts of the group. Impressionism does something similar, although I would tend to say that Impressionistic music still has melodic material that continues to make appearances or be developed. This piece almost takes the textural experimentation of Impressionism to another extreme of the spectrum, moving towards something kind of Totalist. Overall a super cool piece, one of my favorite this semester. It’s definitely something I will be listening to in my free time.",
"Buxtehude was a German composer and organist of the Baroque period. Many of his works have entered into the standard repertoire of organ music, and he had immense influence on Bach. The bulk of his output consisted of vocal music and organ settings of chorales or other sectional forms. Unfortunately, many of his compositions have been lost. Only the librettos of his oratorios survive, and they indicate that the music may have been the model for Bach and Telemann oratorios. His nineteen organ preludes are considered to be his most important contributions to music. The one I listened to definitely seems to sound a bit like Bach’s organ works, as there is continuous development of a theme in a fugal manner. A really cool piece, and I will be searching out more of his surviving works.",
"This popped up in my recommendations on YouTube, and since I remember enjoying the last movement when we played it at Area All State a couple years ago, I thought I would give the whole thing a listen. He was a Russian composer of the Late Romantic and Early Modern Periods. His output was small, as he died at only age thirty four, but he wrote a decent number of songs (with heavy folk influence, typical of the Russian sound during that period), and quite a few orchestral works. He was known by both Tchaikovsky as well as Rachmaninoff, and they both helped support his music before and after his death. His first symphony of two continues to be a staple of Russian orchestras and the wind band arrangement by Glenn Cliffe Bainum is also very popular. It consists of four movements, and it is a cyclic work. The first movement was incredible! They melodies were super memorable, the development was creative and interesting, and texturally, he made great use of the whole orchestra. From what I can remember, the fourth movement uses entirely the same material, so I’m interested to see how he handles it. The second movement is literally so gorgeous. The simple two note ostinato pattern stays consistent throughout almost the whole piece, and the harmonies shifting underneath them is a technique I love to employ in my own writing, as well as something I also adore the sound of. It also turns out that the main melody of this movement is in the last movement as well, so if I’m correct in guessing that the final movement is a recap of the whole piece, then I should recognize some stuff from the third movement. The third movement was amazing as well. I didn’t recognize anything explicitly, but I’m still going to keep my ears open. The last movement made me cry! It was so good! I liked it when we played it, but hearing it with the context of the other movements makes it so much more powerful. I looked again, and surprisingly, I couldn’t find anything from the third movement. I might be missing something obvious, since I find it odd that he would quote movements one and two but not three, but there might be some reasoning behind it. I’ll have to ask Dr. Smith. Overall a really incredible piece. This is definitely, by far, my favorite piece I’ve listened to this semester. I have a feeling it is going to send me down another rabbit hole of listening!",
"Rimsky- Korsakov is one of those names I’ve heard a ton, but don’t know much about outside of nationality and time frame. Since I’ve decided to jump down the Russian well, Dr. Smith suggested I explore him a bit. He was a Russian composer and member of the Mighty Handful, a group of Russian composers including Mily Balakirev, César Cui, Modest Mussorgsky, and Alexander Borodin who were devoted to defining the Russian Sound through nationalism and collaboration. This included using tactics such as tonal mutability (ending pieces in a different key than they started), heterophony, parallel perfect intervals, Orientalism, as well as other unique harmonic devices. Rimsky- Korsakov in particular was interested in the usage of music stylings from Eastern cultures. In this way they went against a lot of the traditional rules of Western harmony and common practice. This being said, Korsakov spent a few years at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory becoming a master of Western techniques before combining them the Russian elements. This included taking influences from people like Glinka, Balakirev, Hector Berlioz, Franz Liszt and, for a brief period, Richard Wagner, and then influencing people like Maurice Ravel, Claude Debussy, and Paul Dukas. This explains why he was later a member of the Belyayev Circle, which was a later group of Russian composers similar to The Five, except they were more accepting of Western influence. He was also a transitional figure from the autodidactism which exemplified Glinka and The Five and professionally trained composers which would become the norm in Russia by the closing years of the 19th century. Its also worth mentioning that he was pretty close with Mussorgsky, and ended up editing a lot of his works. Funnily enough, this piece, composed in 1987, is a Capriccio on Spanish Folk tunes. I’m curious to see if I hear any Russian influence on the work. I think this is kind of tied into that whole Orientalism thing that the Russian composers and even the french explored with. Although Spain isn’t exactly Eastern, it was still exotic to Europe due to the language barrier, the influence of Islam, and even the differing practices of Catholicism (I had to ask Votra about this). All five movement were pretty enjoyable. The percussion section was pretty large to accommodate the various types of Spanish instruments, and at times he had the string section mimicking the technique of guitars. Definitely a strange start to my Russian stint, but an interesting one nonetheless.",
"This piece, composed in 1888, is the last of what many consider to be his three greatest orchestral works (preceded by the Capriccio Espagnol and his Scheherazade). The tunes are largely from the Russian Orthodox Liturgy, and it is dedicated to the memories of  Modest Mussorgsky and Alexander Borodin. The piece was pretty cool. It had an almost German Romantic intensity to it, but not quite the same melodically or harmonically. I would say that overall, it tended to be simpler in those regards, making use of a lot of tonal harmony and the pentatonic scale. It was still an effective piece with more of a Russian sound than the last one.",
"Amy Beach was an American composer and pianist of the Late Romantic and Early Modern periods. Despite a lack of formal training, she was a well known virtuoso in America and abroad, often giving recitals and playing concertos. She was also a part of the unofficial Second New England School, or The Boston Six, a group of six classical music composers from Boston who were pivotal in the development of an American classical idiom that stands apart from its European ancestors. Her symphony in E minor, Gaelic Symphony, was the first symphony composed and published by an American woman. Composed in 1894 and drawing inspiration from both simple old English, Irish, and Scottish melodies, as well as the works of Dvorak, it was very well received at it’s premiere by the Boston Symphony Orchestra. It is four movements long, keeping with the tradition of formal symphonic works. The first movement was pretty fantastic. A lot like the Kalinnikov, it maintained a romanticist level of intensity without sacrificing melody. It was very tuneful throughout and had a nice mix of intensity and reprise. The second movement was lovely. It reminded me a lot of Mercury from The Planets, largely due to its light orchestration, compound meter, and solositic moments interspersed amongst the tutti orchestrations. Movement three was good as well. Very dark and brooding with a lot of contrapuntal lines. The last movement was pretty cool as well. I really liked the primary motif of the melody, and I think it came across really well during the developmental sections. Overall a pretty cool symphony, and certainly very European sounding for being written by an American.",
"This another of the big three Korsakov orchestral works which have received enduring popularity. The suite, composed in 1888, is based on One Thousand and One Nights, a collection of Middle Eastern folk tales compiled in Arabic during the Islamic Golden Age (circa 8th- 14th centuries). The story, as Korsakov put it, is as follows: The Sultan Schariar, convinced that all women are false and faithless, vowed to put to death each of his wives after the first nuptial night. But the Sultana Scheherazade saved her life by entertaining her lord with fascinating tales, told seriatim, for a thousand and one nights. The Sultan, consumed with curiosity, postponed from day to day the execution of his wife, and finally repudiated his bloody vow entirely. The piece is in four movements, with each depicting a different aspect of the story. There have also been ballet adaptations of the work, the premiere of which occured at the Ballet Russes, where many famous composers such as Stravinsky saw their works realized. The first movement, The Sea and Sinbads Ship, was so good! When I first heard the opening melody, I was really uncertain about how he was going to make it work, since it felt kind of all over the place, yet he made it feel so seamless. The arpeggiated open voicings in the lower strings gave the impression of a ship lilting in the waves of the sea, and the eighth note triplets in 6/4 times gave it a really intense forward momentum like wind through the sails. I really liked this metrical technique in particular, giving an almost compound sextuple feel. My research suggested that he may have influenced Debussy and Ravel, and this movement makes that a very apparent possibility. So much of this movement felt oddly Impressionistic, which would make sense given its program. Super awesome movement. Movement two, The Kalandar Prince, was also just absolutely amazing! The piece is cyclic, as is to be expected from a programmatic work, so a lot of the various themes/ leitmotifs from the previous movement were used in here. This included the triplets underneath the beat, this time sixteenth under 3/8. He also did something that I find myself doing while playing piaNumber I have a melody line with harmonic accompaniment, but the harmonic underpinning follows the melody rhythmically and doesn’t change harmonically. It was so cool to hear this orchestrated! I’ve also noticed that he has a lot of cadenzas or cadenza- like solos for various instruments (particularly the violin), as if they are conveying some sort of dialogue. Normally I wouldn’t like the break of momentum, but it works here. I think this is because it fits the character of the work, and other instruments are normally maintaining some kind of movement underneath. I love it! The third movement, The Young Prince and The Young Princess, was also incredible. Again, it reused themes from the prior movements, sometimes hiding them in unexpected places. Amazing. The final movement, Festival at Baghdad. The Sea. The Ship Breaks against a Cliff Surmounted by a Bronze Horseman, honestly just blew me away. It tied everything together so well. The meter for the majority of the movement was notated as 3/8, 6/16, and 2/4 simultaneously, so he could use them at will. It blurred the line between compound and simple meter which he has been doing for the whole, and man it was effective! I also think that my interpretation of the violin as narrator was correct, because the piece closes out with a violin solo, like the narrator coming back one final time to close the story. Really an incredible piece of music, and I can see why it is Korsakov’s most popular work.",
"Prokofiev was a Russian/ Soviet Union pianist, composer, and conductor active at the turn of the early 20th century. His body of work covers a large variety of forms, especially opera and ballet, and his symphonic poem Peter and the Wolf, amongst many other works, have seen enduring popularity. He is often considered to be one of the most popular composers of the 20th century, and his orchestral music is played more frequently in the United States than that of any other composer of the last hundred years save Richard Strauss (thanks concert programming). His music is sometimes viewed as being neoclassical in nature, and he received great praise from Arthur Honegger as a result. He also died on the same day as Joseph Stalin, and as such, it was overshadowed for quite some time. This piece is the third of his Three War Sonatas (sonatas composed during the German invasion of Russia during WWII, a time when the Socialist Realist agenda in music was lifted). Composed in 1944, it is in Bb major and has three movements. The first movement has a wandering, almost atonal melody. Im somewhat surprised by this, given that I read his music was sometimes neoclassical. This could be due to the lift on the Socialist Realist agenda, but its hard to tell. It’s also worth saying that not every work by a composer has to fit into a certain style. Early Schoenberg is surprisingly tonal. I guess its just worth pointing out. The second movement, while still a bit wandering, felt a bit more grounded harmonically than movement one. Its also worth mentioning that movements one and three are significantly longer than movement two. The last movement was pretty technically intense, reminding me almost of something like a toccata. This piece sounded nothing like I was expecting, but it was still pretty cool. I’m thinking about it now, and the stylistic end of this makes sense now. He had to write in a neoclassical style during the Soviet Regime for fear of being executed. These War Sonatas, written during a time when that wasn’t enforced, reflect how he truly feels.",
"I read that this piece was a prime example of Socialist Realist composition, so I decided to check it out. Composed in 1939, it is a short cantata (translating as A Toast) to celebrate Stalin’s 60th birthday. When Prokofiev returned to the Soviet Union, he was under great suspicion of writing works which didn’t conform to their political agenda. This piece was written largely to assuage those fears, especially after the theatre director Vsevolod Meyerhold, who he was collaborating with, was arrested and soon after executed. The text is from a series of poems written by anonymous government writers in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution (which established the Soviet Union). The text is grossly propagandistic, such as the final line which says, You are the banner flying from our mighty fortress! You are the flame that warms our spirit and our blood, O Stalin, Stalin! Right away, the first thing I notice about this piece is just how different it is from his War Sonatas. These were written before Operation Barbarossa (the Axis invasion of Russia), and thus, the Socialist Realist agenda was still being enforced. Since he was also under suspicion upon his return to Russia from abroad in 1936, it makes sense that he would be writing music which didn’t step on any political toes. The War Sonatas were written while the Soviet Union was still fighting German forces, and as such, their attention was not focused on the music being written. If anything, this piece is a perfect example of how politics can influence artistic expression. Very interesting. I also like the piece quite a bit, even though the circumstances behind its composition are unfortunate.",
"Composed in 1915 (during WWI), this piece is an orchestral suite following the Scythians, Eurasian Nomads active from the 9th century BC up until the 4th century AD. It was originally composed as music for a ballet commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, founder of the Ballet Russes, but it was reworked into the orchestral suite after the score was turned down before it was even finished. The piece represents a break from the standard composer-pianist category Prokofiev had represented, as it is one of his first works for orchestra (excluding a couple compositions from when he was a child). The piece is in four movements and is somewhat programmatic. The piece right away sound like something more along the lines of his War Sonatas, which makes sense given the fact that it was composed before the Soviet Union came into power. The first movement, Invocation to Veles and Ala, has an almost Primitivist sound to it, like something from the Rite. Since the Rite premiered only two years prior, and Prokofiev almost certainly heard it through his relationship with the Ballet Russes, I wouldn’t be surprised if he drew inspiration from it (as most 20th century composers did). The second movement, The Evil God and the Dance of the Pagan Monsters, has the same sort of Primitivist sound, which makes sense given the sacrificial nature of the plot. The third movement, Night, while still sounding fairly Primitivist, is really gorgeous. The fourth movement, The Glorious Departure of Lolli and the Cortège of the Sun, again continues forward with the Primitivist trend. Overall a super cool piece which represents yet another face in Prokofiev’s compositional pallette. I ended up looking it up, and Prokofiev indeed saw the Rite a year prior to writing this piece in London, and many see this piece as a continuation of the trend the Rite had started. To me, this is a very apparent fact. Super cool!",
"More music from this book I’m reading. This chapter traces the development of the Backstreet Boys, beginning with this group. New Edition is an American R&B group formed in 1978 and experiencing success in the 80’s with help from their producer Maurice Starr. Candy Girl, the eponymous track of their debut album, was released in 1983 and helped vault them to stardom. The piece is soooo 80’s, and the first thing that strikes me about it is just how young the lead singers are (only in their early teens at the time). It was this group this group, along with Boyz II Men, that became the model for the structure and sound of successful boy bands. The age of the group has a pretty wide range, with differing personalities appealing to a large demographic of people.",
"New Kids on the Block is the group that Maurice Starr formed after New Edition, basically taking the same exact structure and sound and making it white (this could be seen as a classic example of cultural appropriation, taking a certain cultures music for financial gain, but that’s another conversation). The were formed out of Boston by Starr, and immediately made him a lot of money in mostly merchandising. It’s also worth mentioning that most of the group couldn’t really sing, and as such lip synced to pre recorded tracks. Thus began the trend of the industry.",
"So this is where Louis Pearlman comes into the picture. He was an American record producer, cousin of Art Garfunkel of Simon and Garfunkel, and the owner of a popular airline company based in New York City. He saw the success Starr was getting under his musical business model, and using his own wealth of money from his airline, decided to start his own boy band. He again used the same scheme of younger, ‘good looking’ white boys singing R&B inspired music. The group formed out of Orando, where they were later discovered by Pearlman. They were flown to Sweden to work with none other than Dennis Pop and Max Martin, at which point they released their debut album (where this song comes from) to international success. Again, the parallel between them and the work of New Edition, Boyz II Men, and New Kids on the Block is incredibly apparent. The youthful diversity of the group combined with the characteristic R&B (except white) sound is a surefire formula for success. It’s also worth mentioning that the Backstreet Boys can actually sing, a big selling point of Pearlman’s, and Pearlman was also later arrested and sentenced to prison for twenty five years for conspiracy, money laundering, and making false statements during a bankruptcy proceeding. He died in custody in 2016.",
"Written in 1944, this is the fifth of Prokofiev’s seven symphonies. It was written the same year as his eighth piano sonata (one of the three War Sonatas), and as such, he wouldn’t have felt any pressure from the Socialist Realist agenda. As he said, he intended for it to be, a hymn to free and happy Man, to his mighty powers, his pure and noble spirit. It has four movements and is one of his most popular symphonies. The first movement was pretty cool. It started out pretty tonal and straight ahead, but as the piece progressed into the development section and further on, it slowly became more and more chaotic. Pretty interesting. The second movement also played with this frantic, almost chaotic character. The beginning of the symphony was relatively straight forward, but things now sound a lot more akin to the eighth piano sonata than something like Zdravitsa. The third movement sounds like something straight out of E.T. at times, and since I like that score quite a bit, it was a pretty cool movement. Although I may add that the soaring, wandering melodies were interspersed with dark, heavy, menacing passages. The fourth movement too was very exhilarating. A pretty cool symphony overall.",
"Time for some Shosty! I listened to a few of his string quartets last semester, but that listening log is a hot mess, so I’m going to recap some info about him. He was a Russian composer and pianist active during the larger part of the 20th century. He was a polystylism, which is a postmodernist (mid to late 20th century) form which incorporates many different styles into one work. A lot of the big names of this time, including  Alban Berg, Luciano Berio, Pierre Boulez, György Ligeti, Carl Orff, Arvo Pärt, Krzysztof Penderecki, Karlheinz Stockhausen, Igor Stravinsky, and Anton Webern are cited as fitting into this category. Shostakovich drew inspiration from Stravinsky’s neoclassical period, the late German Romanticism of Mahler, as well as other sources. Much like Prokofiev, he had a complicated relationship with the Soviet Union and Stalin, which led to two denunciations for his works as well as his subsequent withdrawal of a couple symphonies to avoid a fate much worse than a negative governmental review. This set of preludes was written after WWII in 1951. Although Shostakovich was out of favor with the Soviet Communist Party, he was still sent abroad as a cultural ambassador. He was asked to sit on a panel at the first International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition, and he was so impressed by the playing of the gold medalist Tatiana Nikolayeva that he began working on his own collection. He ended up dedicating the cycle to her, and she played the premiere in 1952. Overall a pretty interesting set of preludes. It sounds like Chopin mixed with Rzewski.",
"Kyle comes recommended to me by John Hubbs after I played my Nocturne in studio. He said I would like his stuff, so I’ve decided to give this piece a listen. He is a composer and pianist from Massachusetts and now based in Southern California. His bio indicates that he is classically trained, and cites Chopin as his number one influence (which might explain why John made the connection to my piece, since that influence is very apparent). His YouTube channel has a playlist of original compositions, which is where I found this work. Overall it was really nice piece. I feel as though his harmonic language is definitely similar to that of Chopin, although texturally, at least in the case of this piece, I don’t think the parallel is quite as clear. In any case, he’s definitely earned my subscription, and I’m looking forward to future uploads!",
"Another of Buxtehudes preludes for organ. A pretty cool piece which again gets me interested in writing something for organ. He again made use of brief fugal passages, which I really liked the sound of. That really dense and structured form of composition works well against the almost free form, toccata like feel of the rest of the piece.",
"I can’t remember exactly how I found out about this piece, but it was super cool and I really wanted to do an entry on it. I couldn’t find any info on Fenderson other than his YouTube channel and website, where he mostly advertises for this unique and interesting form of music he’s dubbed Oscilloscope Music. An oscilloscope is an electronic test instrument which  displays varying signal voltages, usually as a two-dimensional plot of one or more signals, as a function of time. Sound waves and vibrations can be converted to voltages and displayed as well. Fenderson writes music which, when run through an oscilloscope, produces a visual as well as auditory form of art. The music has a really unique sound, as it needs to be built in a certain way in order to produce images, and the visual end of things is really incredible to witness as well. This music has a lot of moving parts, and it is amazing to see come together so well.",
"I found out about Tigran through David Bruce, where he made a video discussing the incredibly intricate rhythms that Tigran employs in his music. Tigran is an Armenian jazz pianist who likes to incorporate traditional Armenian folk music into his pieces. Right away it makes me think of Aziza Mustafa Zadeh and her album Dance of Fire, which is a jazz album that combines with elements of Azerbaijan folk music (a country which neighbors Armenia). I’m curious if I will hear any similarities in the works! It’s also worth mentioning that Saghmosavank is a 13th century monastic complex in Armenia. Right away, I can definitely hear similarities between this piece and Dance of Fire. The instrumentation is unique and unlike what one might find in a normal jazz setting, making use of traditional instruments such as the Oud. I can also hear that Armenian folk influence really clearly. A super cool sound. I dig it really hard.",
"I haven’t listened to any Ravel in a while, so I thought I’d give this piece a listen. It was composed in 1901 and is dedicated to his teacher, Faure. Just a short, nice piece of piano music.",
"This popped up in my recommendations on YouTube, and while I only wanted to listen to the first couple minutes of it, I ended up listening to the whole thing. It was written in 1935 and is one of his more traditional works. It is in three movements. Overall a pretty cool piece. I again seem to really enjoy Prokofiev’s writing, especially his more conservative, neo- classical stuff. This piece reminds me a bit of the Walton Concerto for Viola, which is of English origin and was written in 1929. That comparison might be a bit of a stretch, but my ear did go there a couple times, especially in the third movement. I really liked the bit where Prokofiev went into 7/8 for a bit. I’m really coming to enjoy the sound of complex meters! Definitely a piece I would listen to again.",
"Another piece from Pearlman’s passion project. This piece was actually written at Cheiron studios after Pearlman and the Backstreet Boys had been introduced to Denniz and Max. They recorded this piece in two days, and then two other pieces as well. Seabrook had this to say:  We’ve Got It Goin’ On Schowcased for the first time the genre- busting combination of influences that converged in Max Martin. The song combines ABBA’s pop chords and textures, Denniz Pop’s song structure and dynamics, ‘80s arena rock’s big choruses, and early ‘90s American R&B grooves. (Seabrook 75) The song didn’t do terribly well in the United States when it was released in 1995 because radios refused to play it (it sounded too European), but it was a massive hit basically everywhere else, and the band went on a sold out international tour. It was ironic when they returned home, and no one knew who they were. All of the things Seabrook had to say about this song seem to hold true. It is incredibly catchy and exhibits all of the characteristics of ‘90s pOpus  I actually don’t mind the piece all that much. If I listened to it a few times I could see it growing on me, which is what it’s designed to do.",
"So this piece has a super interesting history, especially regarding its connection with the rise of Current Hits Radio (CHR). This is one of the other two songs recorded with Max Martin and Denniz Pop at Cheiron Studios, and Pearlman was sitting on it for a time when he could break into the US market. That time came in 1996, when the US Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. One of the major things it did was allow for media cross ownership. Basically, a single entity can own many media outlets. This meant that the number of radio stations a company could own jumped from forty to as many as they wanted. The logic was that creating a national radio network would help struggling broadcasters by increasing the national advertising rate. Within a few years of the passage of the act, Clear Channel and Infinity Broadcasting acquired thousands of radio stations nationally, becoming goliaths in the industry. This meant that they could control the format of how their radio stations played music. Jump back to the early 50’s when Top 40 Radio was invented by Todd Storz and Bill Stewart out of Omaha, Nebraska. They were visiting Storz’s girlfriend, a waitress, in her diner. They noticed that people would play the same 40 songs on the jukebox all day, and even at the end of the day when everyone had left, the waitresses would play those same songs on loOpus  They wrote down the names of those songs and started playing them on loop at their station, and ratings soared. This format took a hit in the 60s and 70s when album oriented rock hit the mainstage, but the idea never disappeared. The format made a comeback in 1983 at New York City’s local Z- 100 station. Scott Shannon, the newly hired programming director, brought back the idea of Top 40 radio but with current hits only. The station became the number one station in the number one market of the country, feeding off the music of Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, The Police, Cyndi Lauper, and Bruce Springsteen. Clear Channel acquired the station after the Telecommunications Act, and just like that, the format was funneled through the rest of their stations nationally, birthing the sound. Pearlman tried to break the market once more with this piece in 1997, and it shot up to number two on the Hot 100. The piece again sounds a lot like We’ve Got It Goin’ On, except this time it had the help of CHR to break through the US market.",
"So this is Pearlman’s other group, almost exactly like the Backstreet Boys, that he formed without telling them during the time when they were having trouble breaking the US market. He figured he might as well monopolize on the opportunity before someone else did, especially since he had the resources and know how. The All- New Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, a powerhouse for teen talent supplied by Disney, was cancelled in 1996, and Justin Timberlake, one of the show’s lead talents, became interested in joining Pearlman’s group. Add a little bit of money and Cheiron magic, and NSYNC is born. This piece was their debut single, and helped them to rise to popularity in the states. The parallels are very apparent between the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC, both in terms of the sound and the look. It’s really easy to tell that the same minds were behind both groups.",
"Britney Spears also came from The All- New Mickey Mouse Clubhouse, and she too was in a contract with Perlman briefly for a female counterpart to NSYNC know as Innosense. She dropped out at the last minute to go for a solo career and began applying with talent agencies and record labels. Eventually she was picked up by Clive Davis at Jive Records and matched with Max Martin, who wrote the hit. The label changed the title to Baby One More Time to avoid people confusing Swedish slang for ‘Call Me’ with some call to domestic abuse, and she took off. The song is pretty wild in the sense that it still has the NSYNC and Backstreet Boys sound, but female. The music video is also sexualized for the male audiences, analogous to the way that NSYNC and the Backstreet Boys were for female audiences. Really interesting, even though I’m not a huge fan of the song. It’s definitely catchy, but I just can’t get past her singing. Ok I’ll admit that I listened to it again. Max Martin knows what he’s doing. I also wanted to point out a sorta parallel I noticed between her and Elvis Presley, poor whites from the south rising to pop stardom. Not sure how fair of a comparison that is since I don’t know a ton about Elvis, but the demographic is there nonetheless. Elvis also covered popular songs by Black artists of the time and made them popular in white audiences (cultural appropriation). Britney didn’t do that exactly, but the groups that directly preceded her certainly did.",
"So we talked about this piece in my lesson today, the first movement in particular, since I am writing the first movement of my saxophone quartet in sonata form. Paul Hindemith was a German composer of the 20th century. He was a major advocate of New Objectivity (a reaction against the expressionist movement of the 1920’s which sought to encourage practical engagement with the world rather than the abstract, philosophical interpretations characteristic of expressionism). He initially composed expressionist works, but later on became more adept to New Objectivity and an almost neo baroque sound heavy in counterpoint. This piece, written in 1938, exhibits that character both in its form as well as its polyphonic textures. The form of the first movement is of marked originality, as his exclusion of the B theme in the recapitulation means that the modulatory material from A to B of the exposition turns into the coda.",
"Continuing my exploration of Sonata Form, Dr. Smith suggested that I listen to the first of Mozart’s twelve piano sonatas. The first of this sonata is pretty clear in terms of its structure. The A Theme is repeated once and slightly varied before moving into a momentum building section. There is a Medial Caesura before the B Theme enters in the dominant key. There is then another section (called the post codetta) which basically leads us to the final cadence of the exposition. In this case, the exposition is repeated. The piece then moves into a short development of the A theme before reintroducing that A theme in the recapitulation. This time, at the repeat of the A theme, he does it in the key of the relative minor before moving into the B theme, played in the tonic key. A short coda then leads us to the ending of the movement. The slight deviations from the classical sonata form shows that the structure has some wiggle room regarding what happens.",
"Another Sonata Form piece. It’s actually becoming easier to analyze the form the more I listen to pieces that use it. This piece is pretty straightforward in its usage of the form, although I did notice that he varied both themes slightly during the recapitulation. I really liked this movement.",
"Emilie Mayer was a German female composer of the Romantic Period. Active from the mid to late 19th century, she was a very prolific composer, producing some eight symphonies and at least fifteen concert overtures, plus numerous chamber works and lieder. She was also the Associate Director of the Opera Academy in Berlin. Her early works tend to be influenced by a more Viennese Classical style, while her later works tend to be more Romantic. This piece, composed in 1956, is one of her later works. Right away the piece certainly has a Romantic sound, although I can definitely hear some late Beethoven influence in her harmonies as well as her woodwind scoring. The sound is so distinctly Beethoven, yet she manages to give it a unique spin. Overall I really enjoyed the piece.",
"This piece was composed in 1943 in Samara, where he had been evacuated due to the Siege of Leningrad. I really enjoyed the first movement. It felt like the left and right hands were having a conversation throughout. The second movement had this very ethereal, wandering quality that I quite enjoyed. I need to rant about the third movement for a bit. This movement is wandering, dissonant, chromatic, and unsure almost the entire time; however, there are the moments interspersed throughout that are just absolutely beautiful. Everytime they come, I wish they would stay forever, but they don’t. They always dissolve back into the nebulous. Normally this would frustrate me, but now I totally get it. I’ve been thinking a lot recently about what it means to be alive, even though we only remember a select few moments in our lives before we are dead and forgotten by many. Over the past week, I’ve come to realize that, for me at least, its about enjoying the time we do have. Nothing lasts forever. The good always comes with the difficult, frustrating, and confusing, but that is part of life. All we can do is enjoy those ephemeral moments of clarity while they are here, and look forward to when they will come again. At least to me, this piece represents that. I don’t know if Shostakovich would have held the same view, but given the context of this piece’s composition, I wouldn’t be completely surprised. More specifically, I would also like to point out something about the opening of the movement. This chromatic and wandering line plays unaccompanied for almost a whole page. I had no idea what he was going to do with it or how he was going to make it work, but as soon as he added the harmonic layer, it began to make perfect, beautiful sense. Sometimes viewing those negative aspects of our life under a different lense gives them new meaning to us. This is all personal interpretation, and I could be way off base with all of this, but what does it matter really. I enjoyed thinking about it, and this moment which I will probably forget in a couple of weeks will have at least been a bright spot on my day in the present.",
"The last of Kalinnikov’s symphonies. I didn’t like it as much as the first, but it is still a really incredible piece of music. His writing for brass is really spectacular, and his sense of melody is astounding. The folk tune influence is still present and welcomed. I also noticed a lot of similarities between this piece and his first symphony on both a melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic scale. Very interesting, and it is a shame he didn’t live long enough to compose more. Like Lili, another great gone to soon. I will definitely be checking out some of his other stuff sometime soon. If they’re anything like his symphonies, I’m certain I will love and draw inspiration from them.",
"This popped up in my recommendations, and since I had a few free minutes, I figured I would check it out. Poulenc was part of Les Six, and this piece was composed one year before his death in 1962. The thing that sticks out to me most about this piece is the harmony. It seems as though he is using a lot of ‘jazz chords,’ or altered extended harmonies. He seems to be quite fond of the dom7(b9)(b13), for example. These types of harmonies weren’t necessarily uncommon in classical music, but they were often treated as embellishing tones rather than actual agogic accents, as Poulenc treats them here. I must say I am also a bit surprised by the fact the a French Neoclassicist has used them in an oboe sonata, but it is later in his life and styles do change. Who am I to put a box around him! I must say, I was really quite fond of this piece. It sounded almost like Vince Guaraldi wrote an oboe sonata. It had that traditional structure and instrumentation, yet the harmonic twists were always exciting and making ear jump to jazz standards. Very cool!",
"I FOUND IT!!!!!! After my struggles trying to find this album last semester, I started to keep my eyes open. Two days ago I found it in the used records bin at Goodwill for a buck, and it’s in fantastic condition. I ordered a new belt and preamp for my record player, and two days later, I’m sitting here listening to it. The album is everything it’s said to be. The contrapuntal nature of Bach’s music is absolutely perfect for showcasing the capabilities of the Moog synthesizer. Every voice has a unique timbre, and those timbres change from piece to piece, giving each a totally unique character. Really amazing album, and I definitely want to figure out a way to have it recorded and saved digitally. I think I have a setup that can accommodate that, so I will just have to figure it out.",
"Dvorak was a Czech composer of the late Romantic Period. Following in the footsteps of his predecessor Bedřich Smetana, he was a nationalistic composer who employed folk tunes of Moravia and Bohemia in his music. It’s worth mentioning that Brahms was a big proponent of his music after judging on the panel of the Austrian State Prize for Composition, to which Dvorak submitted scores. His ninth symphony, The New World Symphony, has become his most popular work and one of the most popular symphonies in existence. It’s composition was inspired by his travels to America, where he became infatuated by the wide open spaces as well as the folk music of Native Americans and African Americans. This influence is very evident in every movement of the symphony, where the melodies have a very folk tune characteristic about them. He also makes extensive use of the major pentatonic scale, a technique that Aaron Copland would later employ when trying to convey the openness of America. It also clear why Brahms was such a huge proponent of his music, as the piece comes across to me as a moderately conservative work for being composed in 1893. Overall I really liked the piece, especially the last movement.",
"After Clarkson achieved stardom from winning American Idol, she was set out with Clive Davis to produce a hit record. American Idol, modeled after the British Pop Idol, was a means by which to encourage the search for talent. Davis did not foresee it producing any long term stars, but it was a means by which to keep the so called pure pop fresh in the American Market. Clarkson won with her cover of A Moment Like This, thus beginning her legacy. She was matched with Max Martin and Dr. Luke, an up and coming record producer, to make a hit. The gave her the song Since Youve Been Gone, and she recorded it in spite of wanting to write her own material. She also butted heads with Martin and Luke in the studio since they were so hands on. The song, totally characteristic of Martins writing, sold over 11 million copies. In the post- Napster days, this was almost unheard of. I find it interesting that Davis let her do her own album, My December, a few albums later, and it only barely broke 1 million copies sold. The following album, All I Ever Wanted, she again worked with Martin and Luke. The album was a hit. This shows that a TV show can help an artist to get noticed, but in the world of Pop, only a record man can make a star.",
"Time for something really different, KPOpus  This group represents the beginnings of the genre, which was pioneered by Lee Soo- Man. Lee sought to combine influences from both traditional Korean Music as well as Western music. In particular, he drew inspiration from the structure and marketing techniques of the Backstreet Boys and Louis Pearlman. Lee, upon founding his talent/ record company SM Entertainment, also coined the term Cultural Technology. Cultural Technology is an actual handbook written by SM Entertainment to aid in the dissemination of culture to other areas. According to The New Yorker, The manual, which all S.M. employees are instructed to learn, explains when to bring in foreign composers, producers, and choreographers; what chord progressions to use in what country; the precise color of eyeshadow a performer should wear in a particular country; the exact hand gestures he or she should make; and the camera angles to be used in the videos (a three-hundred-and-sixty-degree group shot to open the video, followed by a montage of individual closeups). H.O.T., short for Highfive of Teenagers, was created by SM Entertainment under the Cultural Technology model in 1996. They experienced great success in South Korea and also abroad. They were among the first members of the Korean Wave, an influx of Korean Culture into adjacent areas. The music video of this song seems to fit the characteristics described regarding camera shots; a 360 degree pener followed by individual shots on the performers. I think it’s also interesting that the lyrics are all in Korean save the opening lines, which is a countdown of numbers in English. I feel as though this was a means by which to draw in audiences from English speaking countries, even though English speakers wouldn’t be able to understand the rest of the song. Very interesting song with a lot of similarities to Pearlman’s model. I’d be curious to see how other KPop relates to this.",
"Time for some Uncle Bela. This piece comes per the recommendation of Jodie White. Bela was a Hungarian composer, pianist, and ethnomusicologist. Along with Franz Liszt, he is regarded as one of Hungary’s greatest composers. It was his cross- cultural study of music, comparative musicology, that helped with the development of ethnomusicology. His music was heavily influenced by Strauss, Brahms, and Debussy. His music is also notable for embracing the breakdown of diatonic harmony (as was evident in his Mikrokosmos), as well as the use of Nationalism as a source of musical inspiration. The Miraculous Mandarin is a one act ballet finished in 1924, and inspired by the works of Stravinsky, Strauss, and Schoenberg. It is a story of prostitution, robbery, and murder that was banned after its premiere due to its content. Also immediately, the influence of the Rite can be heard. Like Prokofiev’s Scythian Suite, the rapidly shifting meters, obscuration of downbeats, driving ostinatos, and primitivist textures are very apparent. Looking online, under the same article I read, it can be seen that many view this work as yet another continuation of the Rite. The piece also reminds me a bit of Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire in its unsettling, atonal harmonies and melodies. It’s very clear to me why those composers are cited as sources of inspiration to Bela, especially when it comes to this piece. Lso, there’s a choir in this piece. I didn’t notice it until the very end of the piece, so I’m not sure if he didn’t use it until the end or it was just blending really well. If it is the former, then what a big flexxer. Also, three measures from the end, I swear that is the flute solo from Debussy’s Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun in the bassoon. Granted it is pretty much just a descending chromatic scale, but the similarity stuck out to me. I had to come back to this, in Fall of 2019 as I’m listening to his fourth string quartet. Debussy was a huge source of inspiration for him, so I wouldn’t be surprised if he did quote Afternoon of a Faun.",
"After my discussion with Emmanuel yesterday, I decided it was finally time to dive into some Tchaikovsky. He was a Russian composer of the Romantic period, and due to his Western training at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory, he had a complicated professional relationship with the Nationalist composers of the Mighty Five. He was also a homosexual, and there is much debate as to weather his death from cholera in 1893 was accidental or self inflicted. This piece, inspired by the Shakespeare tragedy of the same name, is a symphonic- poem- like Overture Fantasy that seeks to tell the famous tale musically. The love theme from the piece has had immense impact on popular culture as well as other composers. The thing I notice right away about this piece is his use of repetition. From what I’ve read, repetition is a really big part of Russian composition and also Tchaikovsky’s style in general. Looking back, this is certainly apparent to a degree in the other Russian composers I’ve studied; however, I didnt like it as much in the case of this piece. At least for the first half, things felt pretty long winded, like they were having trouble getting started. Once things were underway I really enjoyed the piece, and I’m not trying to diminish his apparent skill with orchestration and melody writing, but to my ears, things felt slow at times. I will say, however, that the repetition was very effective in making his themes stick. The repetition isn’t inherently bad, but I do think that there needs to be a balance with things. The first two minutes of this piece felt unnecessarily long, and I think the first half in general could have been shorter without losing too much of the impact. I will have to revisit this piece again sometime and see if my perception is the same. All in all, a pretty cool piece.",
"Another SM Entertainment group. An eight member group, SNSD represents the control SM Entertainment has over the creation of stars. Most of the members of these groups start out very young and are recruited by talent scouts under the company’s payroll. From there, they spend years training in dance, performance, interview etiquette, language, and media behavior. In the Eastern pop music market, the image of group members can instantly make or break a career, and SM Entertainment ensures that their groups know how to act before a debut. They are an investment, and they are treated as such. Their physical appearances are also vital, and many members often undergo plastic surgery to enhance their appearances. This is part of the reason that Eastern Asia has become such a huge market for plastic surgery. This single, released in 2005, is often considered the standard for KPop and was wildly successful internationally. Like the H.O.T piece, I notice that the opening lines are in English, while the rest is in Korean. I find this attempt to appeal at a larger market incredibly interesting. The music video is also every single KPop cliche I can think of in one video, which makes its status as a KPop standard seem pretty reasonable. I have to imagine that this is the kind of level of control Pearlman wished he could have reached with his music production career.",
"This piece is interesting in that PSY is from outside of the Industrial Music ring of Korea, and it is his satirization of KPop trends that allowed him to break into the US Market. Gangnam Style, referring to the Gangnam district of Seoul, mocks the lifestyle associated with that area- a lifestyle which the Music Industry Giants located there helped to create. I again find it interesting that the lyric Sexy Lady is in English.",
"I love the Brian Setzer Orchestra’s rendition of this song, so I thought I would give the original a listen. This song, released as a single in 1958, was a big hit for the group. I think the difference in style between the two covers is the most interesting thing about the piece, with the Skyliners’ take being in that classic doo- wop realm, and the Setzer Orchestra taking it into the swing revival of the 90’s (their rendition on the album Dirty Boogie was released in 1998). I would love to write a piece with that kind of big band sound, so I will definitely be looking into more of that stuff from the 30’s and 40’s. Admittedly, despite having played a bit of this style of music in Jazz Band, I had to look up its history. I guess it’s something I’ve been neglecting to do! I am going to be checking out more Ellington and Benny Goodman, and then going from there.",
"Finally time for some Prince. I have so much of his stuff from my dad, and since Tocco gave me some recommendations, I decided its time to dive on in. Prince was an American singer, songwriter, musician, record producer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for helping develop the Minneapolis sound, a subgenre of Funk- Rock that developed in the late 70’s. He was a multi- instrumentalist, often playing many instruments on the same album, and he is often associated with his extravagant and eclectic stage appearance. Purple Rain is his sixth studio album and the first to feature his band Revolution. The film would also serve as a soundtrack for his movie of the same name. Released in 1984, the album was an immense success. It is the third best selling soundtrack of all time, and is considered by many to be one of the most important albums ever produced. It contains some of his greatest hits, including When Doves Cry, Let’s Go Crazy, and, of course, Purple Rain. Right away, the synth sound of the Funk- Pop genre is very evident. I guess this is the reason why I get momentary reminders of Genesis and their Prog- Rock sound. Tocco had mentioned that one of the reasons he liked Prince is because, He ALWAYS grooves, and this too is very evident. It’s really easy to settle into the groove of the piece without any difficulty. This is something I have been paying a lot of attention to recently. Some pieces have an undeniable groove, and I’m trying to figure out exactly why that is. It seems as though its consistency of composite rhythms and agogic stresses within phrases. This also means that when things change, the break of expectation is exciting and heightens those moments. I’m definitely going to go digging for the Prince CD’s I have and put them in my, car because I really enjoyed this album. Tocco was totally right. It grooves hard, the sound is super unique, and it’s really just fun to listen to.",
"Another Prince album recommended by Tocco. Released in 1987, this is considered to be Prince’s greatest album. The songs on it were initially supposed to be part of a few other records, but when Prince abandoned the idea, he compromised with record executives and released some of them on this double album. It is his ninth studio album and his first after the disbandment of The Revolution. The first track, Sign O’ the Times is noticeably different from Purple Rain. It’s much blusier, and it very clearly addresses various social issues present during the 80’s. The second track is also radically different. It seems as though this album is going to be pretty eclectic in terms of style. It also grooves hard and is fun to listen to.",
"David Bruce just did a video on this piece, so I thought I’d give it a listen. He talked about pieces which are teleological, or have an end goal in mind. In the case of this piece, it is the destruction of the traditional Waltz form. The piece explores the forms birth, its golden days, and its eventual death. David also makes the argument that WWI had some influence on this somewhat dark program, although Ravel denied this claim. The piece was premiered in 1920. The so called ‘death’ of the waltz was cool, but I much more liked its ‘birth.’ It was really cool to hear little fragments of ideas start to emerge from harmonic stasis, and it is something I might experiment with myself. Cool piece.",
"Some more from Seabrook’s book. Jay- Z, or Shawn Carter, is one of the most influential public figures of the last two decades. He grew up in NYC selling his CD’s under the table, forming his label Roc- A- Fella Records. This was later acquired by Def Jam Records, a subsidiary of the Universal Music Group. This piece is off his first album, Reasonable Doubt. It was this album that helped solidify his standing in the music industry, especially in the area of hip- hop and urban music. He would later produce some very famous artists within the genre, including Kanye West and Rihanna. The song has a really solid backbeat, which is characteristic of the hip- hop genre.",
"This story starts with Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, a songwriting duo that has produced a variety of hits. Rogers met her through his wife’s friend, Rihanna’s mother in the Barbados. After hearing her sing, he convinced her to travel with him to NYC. She recorded a demo which was sent out to a variety of record labels, including Def Jam Records. Jay- Z immediately invited her in to audition, and when she performed this piece for him, he wouldn’t let her leave the building until a record contract was negotiated. She has gone through many image changes since that point, but it was that meeting which got her career started. That same, strong hip- hop backbeat is still evident, although her vocals have much more edge than the Jay- Z piece. I’m not a huge fan of the piece, but I can see how it would have been appealing.",
"This piece is off her third studio album from 2007, Good Girls Gone Bad, and it defined who she was as an artist at the time. The piece was also an immense success in the United States, and is one of the best selling singles of all time. Again, the strong hip- hop backbeat is very evident. I actually don’t mind this piece too much, but I find much more value in its production history and significance than anything else. Its worth mentioning that this piece was originally intended for Britney Spears, but it was rejected as she was having her mental breakdown. The composition of this piece is kind of funny as well, as Tricky Stewart, Kuk Harrell, and the Dream were messing around on Logic when it was spontaneously improvised by all three.",
"Some more Gubaidulina. I listened to her piece Stimmen Verstummen a couple semesters ago, and I really enjoyed that piece. This piece exemplifies her use of traditional Russian instruments and folk tunes within a modern framework. De Profundis is the opening of the Latin translation of the 130th Psalm, rendered in English as Out of the depths [I call to Thee, O Lord]. This was a really cool piece. I think the various timbres of the Bayan, an instrument similar to the accordion, lent themselves well to the subject matter of the composition. It certainly did feel like things were coming from the depths at times.",
"This is as much a film as it is a piece of music. Released in 1982, it is a trilogy of documentaries about the interactions between Nature, Man, and Technology. This film, which is Hopi for ‘Life Unbalanced,’ is about man’s ever increasing distance from the natural world. A sort of visual tone poem, the simple imagery, music, and lack of narration seek to convey the message that man has strayed away from nature. Godfrey Reggio, the film’s director, said about the lack of narration, its not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. Its because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live. I think this is where Glass’s score comes into play, as it is the bridge of understanding in the context of this film. The imagery and music not only juxtapose mankind with the natural world around it, but also the prosperous elements of society with those of destruction. The film is very minimalist (duh), yet it conveys so much meaning. There were certainly some really powerful moments which the music helped to augment, such as the movement from a lot full of cars to a field full of tanks. A really interesting work that I think is more relevant now than ever.",
"I was very excited to see another piece by Tailleferre (with score!) pop up in my YouTube recommendations. I couldn’t find much info on this piece, other than that it was inspired by the works of Maurice Ravel and was written in 1920. That said, I’m curious if I will hear any parallels to his La Valse, which I listened to a few weeks ago. I will, of course, also be listening for some neo- classical/ Les Six influences as well. Damn was it an awesome piece of music! Really just absolutely incredible. I think the piece had the melodic strength evident in neo- classical pieces such as her string quartet, but I definitely heard an Impressionist influence in this piece. Texturally, rhythmically, and harmonically, it felt like it was pretty adventurous and cusping into the realm of something that Ravel might have written. It’s also worth mentioning that his La Valse was written in the same year as this piece, so I’m almost certain there is some type of connection there. It was only three years later that she started taking private lessons with him in his home, so I’m very curious to read into that whole relationship. Super cool piece, I really enjoyed it. Certainly one of my new favorites.",
"The final installment of Adams’s trilogy! The first, Become Ocean, won the Pulitzer Prize in 2014, and since I really enjoyed that, I was very excited that Become Desert was finally premiered. I found an interview where he discusses the compositional process of the piece, and it was super interesting. He said the central idea of the piece was Close your eyes and listen to the singing of the light. He said that space was a primary concern for the piece, and he didn’t actually start planning the piece until he knew exactly where the ensemble was sitting physically. He viewed the layout as five separate ensemble choirs, whereas Become Ocean only had three. I think it’s interesting that, despite this grander scale of things, this piece feels much more open and sparse than Become Ocean. I think that the reason for this is that his goal of immersion was executed incredibly well. The piece is really beautiful, and much like Become Ocean, it’s very easy to become lost in the sonic landscapes he manages to create. I will have to listen to Become River next.",
"I’ve decided to listen to some of João’s music since he passed away yesterday. I’ve always been a big fan of the Getz/ Gilberto album that he helped create, and I also really like the Bossa Nova sound in general, but this album in specific comes from a post that Jacob Collier made on Instagram. He said this album was vital in shaping his way of thinking about music, and given his unique sound, I’m very curious to hear what this album is like. The only information I found on it is that it was released in 1991, so I will also be curious to see how his sound changed since earlier in his career. This album is fascinating, and it is evident that he experiments with things a bit more in this album. The core elements of his Bossa Nova style are there, but stacked on top of it is newer instrumentations (including strings and woodwinds). Maybe it’s because my ears are used to the Getz/ Gilberto album, but these instrument groups sound like they surround the Bossa Nova ensemble and give it an incredibly rich and layered sound. It is this aspect that I think Jacob draws the majority of his inspiration from, as this idea of stacking and surrounding core ideas is very apparent within his own original music and arrangements. I’m a huge fan of this album, and I would love to get my hands on a physical copy to play in my car. It’s a shame he’s gone, but he brought a lot of music to this world, and this album is proof that I still have much to explore. Rest easy, João.",
"I don’t remember how I found this piece, but I am listening to it nonetheless. The piece, translated as Voice of the Whale, was composed in 1971 for electric flute, cello and amplified piano, and it inspired by recordings Crumb heard of whale songs. It is suggested that the performers wear half black masks under blue lighting. It is in eight movements, with the middle six representing different geological time periods. The cello is tuned scordatura, which is simply a non standard tuning. The first movement had the flutist sing into their instrument while playing, and I thought that technique had a really interesting sound. The second movement, the first of the geological time periods, has what I swear is a reference to the opening of Richard Strauss’s Also Sprach Zarathustra. The flute outlines the open fifth and fourth originally in the trumpet, before the piano comes in with the two orchestral hits and then the timpani’s notes muffled down in its lower register. The movie that made the opening of that piece famous, 2001: A Space Odyssey, was released in 1968, just three years before this piece was written. It is used to signify the dawn of mankind, and I would not be surprised if that is where Crumb got the inspiration to quote it. The final movement, Sea Nocturne, is incredibly beautiful in a haunting sort of way. I random connection made in post: The last movement ends with the piano player miming the final measure. This reminds me of the Conductor’s Cadenze from Gubaidulina’s Stimmen Verstimmen",
"YouTube took me on a Leonard Bernstein kick today, and I found a video discussing Shosty’s 9th. He talked about how Beethoven’s ninth was idolized by a lot of Romantic period composers, and many either never wrote that many symphonies or found ways around naming them as such. Such was the case with Mahler, as he named his ninth symphony Das Leid Von Der Erde for that very reason. There was always a fear of not being able to live up to Beethoven’s image, so most composers didn’t try (Dvorak and Bruckner were exceptions to this, and their ninth symphonies were also very grand). Shosty’s ninth was originally meant to be a massive and grand celebration of the Soviet defeat of Germany during WWII, but by the time he completed work in 1945, it was completely different in character. It was more analogous to a work by Haydn in terms of strictness of form as well as the light hearted nature. Bernstein argues this change of character was Shosty’s way of both snubbing Stalin and the mysterious ‘Symphony Number 9’ superstition. In either case, the light hearted character is very apparent. The opening theme is unexpected, light, and humorous. The ending also has this random V- I cadence that is totally out of character for the piece, which might be a little jab at the cliche endings of Classical Period symphonies. On a more general note, the macroscopic form of the symphony is unique. It has five movements instead of the traditional four, and the whole performance lasts only around twenty five minutes. I find this to be very interesting, and wonder if it is another supposed attempt to mock those circumstances around him. Overall, a pretty cool piece.",
"Time for some Jacob. He just released this album, and since his music has really grown on my lately, I decided it was time to give it a listen. Not much to say other than that it’s pretty great, as usual. His collaborators are pretty well known people as well.",
"This album comes recommended by John Tocco, since I am trying to listen to more music with lyrics. Martha is a Canadian- American folk singer/ songwriter born in 1976. She was raised in a musical family along with her brother Rufus Wainwright, an actor and musician known for, among many things, his recording of Leondard Cohen’s Hallelujah on the movie Shrek. This album is her first and was released in 2005.",
"Ben Johnston passed away a couple days ago, and Professor Jansen suggested that people listen to this piece in his honor. Johnston was an American contemporary composer known for his use of microtonality and development of the idea of extended just intonation. From the way I understand it, Just Intonation is the idea that all intervals can be derived from higher orders of the Harmonic Series rather than by the irrational numbers of Equal Temperament. Hi fascination with this subject was a result of his time working with Harry Partch, another pioneer of the concept. Johnston extended his work (pun intended), and developed notation for it. In this way, his String Quartets are very difficult to perform, due to the attention performers have to pay to accurately reproducing the indicated microtones. Number 5 is amongst the most microtonal of all his String Quartets. The first thing that strikes me about the quartet is its relative accessibility. The microtonality is apparent, but not to a degree where it is inaccessible. There is still a lot of really beautiful musicality hidden within that is really unique. It has some abrasive moments, but part of me thinks they are perceived that way only because we are used to an Equal Temperament system. I imagine that listening to this music a lot would result in a deeper appreciation and perception of its nuances. Really interesting.",
"Another recommendation from Tocco. I’ve heard of these guys, but outside of a few songs here and there, I’ve never really sat down and listened to their music before. They were a folk- rock duo that formed in the late 50’s out of Queens. Their first album was a flop and they disbanded for a time, but they eventually came back together and had a string of chart topping records throughout the 60’s. They were incredibly successful until a rocky artistic relationship led to their breakup in 1970. Bookends, released in 1968, was their fourth studio album. It came after their successes with the albums Sounds of Silence and Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme as well as the soundtrack album for the 1967 film The Graduate. It is a concept album that explores life’s journey from childhood to old age. The album was a critical success that brought them to stature with the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan, and it put them at the forefront of the 1960’s countercultural revolution. The production process of the album is said to have been long and tedious, and the album is often compared thematically to the Beatles’s Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, released ten months prior. Overall a pretty cool album. It seemed more about random pieces of someone’s life rather than a continuous plot, but I still enjoyed listening to it. It had a very mellow and pleasant 60’s sound. I watched the Graduate last night. Pretty interesting movie. It was kind of all over the place and symbolic in meaning. It was satirizing the social issues of youths in the 60’s and became a prominent addition to the countercultural movement of that time. I found it interesting that this was the case with their music as well, which may be part of the reason the filmmakers chose them to score it. It’s also the movie where the song Mrs. Robinson came from, as she is one of the key antagonists in the story.",
"Another album from Simon and Garfunkel. This is their fifth and final album, released in 1970. The album was released to mixed reception, but later became a massive hit and went on to win two Grammys. The album has a more eclectic sound than Bookends, incorporating elements of Gospel and Jazz. I really liked the song So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright. There were sections that had some really interesting things happening harmonically. Another really cool album. I enjoyed this one a bit more than Bookends, although they are both great. Makes me want to explore more music from the 60’s. I might dive into the Beatles next…",
"As I said, time for some Beatles. I chose this album first since it was released in 1967, only a year before Bookends. I’ve enlisted Votra in guiding me through their most influential albums, as he is a Beatles nut with a degree in music. That being said, the importance of this album cannot be understated. The whole idea was started by McCartney (supposedly under the influence of LSD), who envisioned an alter ego (Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band) that would allow them to experiment freely. Thus, it became a key example of the Countercultural Revolution of the 60’s. It is one of the first examples of a concept album, helping to begin the age of progressive rock. It’s use of cyclic form helped bridge the gap between pop and art rock, and its novelties of production (such as tape manipulation) helped introduce the idea of ‘the studio as an instrument.’ Most of the tracks couldn’t be reproduced live, and thus, their initial performances became the album itself. The album is their eighth, and it also represents their dissatisfaction with live performances. According to Lennon, it wasn’t about the music anymore, but about the group members. It is also worth mentioning their interest with avant-garde and electronic-music composers such as Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage and Luciano Berio. The studio production was also pretty complex, as they only had four track mixers available, and thus had to use reduction mixing (a technique in which one to four tracks from one recorder are mixed and dubbed down onto a master four-track machine, enabling the engineers to give the group a virtual multitrack studio). The album makes extended use of signal processing as well as the newly invented ambiophonics (basically, stereo has an issue where the left and right signals also reach the opposite ears, which causes comb filtering, or cross talk, that distorts the timbre of central voices. Ambiophonics reduces this issue using some magic I don’t quite understand). Super cool album. I need to listen to it again.",
"Another Beatlees album. This one released in 1965, their sixth studio album. This album represents their growing maturity as lyricists, their desire towards more colorful and eclectic instrumentations/ orchestrations, and it was also key in the movement away from singles to a more album based approached to creating music. This trend would shift back to singles in the late 90’s and early 2000’s after Napster, but album based writing was in vogue until then. In that regard, this album sort of got the ball rolling before Sgt. Pepper’s really solidified the matter. The album draws inspiration from African American Soul music. Plastic Soul is a term which signifies Soul music that lacks soul, and their album title is a play on that phrase. I really like the tune Norwegian Wood. Super cool. I liked the album overall, but I definitely prefer Sgt. Pepper’s a bit more. This seems pretty on par with my musical tastes.",
"The last Beatles album Votra recommended to me, this one their eleventh being released in 1969. Although Let It Be was released after this album, most of that music had already been recorded, so the music on this album is the last time the group spent in the studio together. The album was an immediate success, and the image on the front cover of them walking across the zebra stripes in front of Abbey Road studios has become a pop icon. The album was recorded on eight track reel to reel tape, unlike the four tracks they had used in prior albums, and it makes use of the Moog Synthesizer and the Leslie Speaker (baffled fins spinning in front of the speaker cone to produce a tremolo effect). The album was recorded entirely on a solid state transistor mixing desk, which allowed them more capabilities with the eight tracks. A solid state transistor uses a semiconductor to amplify or switch (make or break a circuit) electronic signals across an input and output pair of terminals. The same effect used to be accomplished through thermionic valves, or vacuum tubes (which can also be used in a variety of ways). There was also the Paul is Dead conspiracy, which obviously turned out to be false. I really liked the ending of I Want You, and the Moog’s feature in Because was an amazingly cool timbral detail. The End was a super cool way to end off their, what many argue, is their final album. Every member of the band gets their little moment to play a solo, and the lyric And in the end, the love you take is equal to the love you make is super meaningful and nice. I have to agree with Votra that it should have been the last track, and not Her Majesty. Overall a cool album, a bit more straight ahead than Sgt. Pepper’s, and more like Rubber Soul than anything.",
"Leroy was an American composer of short, light orchestral pieces. We was active for the better part of the 20th century, and many of his pieces were premiered by the Boston Pops Orchestra. His most famous pieces are Sleigh Ride and The Syncopated Clock. This piece, composed in 1947, I heard while working at Symphoria. I really enjoyed it, so I thought I would give it a listen. The upbeat Latin feel, punctuated by brief periods of silence, is very fun to listen to. I definitely want to check out more of his music now!",
"James MacMillan is a Scottish composer. A devout Roman Catholic, his music is often infused with both spiritual and political messages. This piece is a cantata (the meaning has changed over time, but it is essentially a multimovement work for choir and instrumental accompaniment) for choir and strings written in 1993. In it, he sets the seven phrases uttered by Jesus as he was being crucified (this text has been set by numerous other composers, including Haydn and Gubaidulina). The first movement was incredibly affecting. The juxtaposition between the purity/ consonance of the choir and the wandering dissonance of the strings is stark and powerful. I see it as a representation of the purity of Jesus in the midst of the hatred and sin around him. The second movement was also really powerful in the way it handled the text. The majority of the movement features full choir singing Woman, behold, thy son! with sections of wandering strings interjected between. In general, these sections sound grand and divine. The last half of the phrase, Son, behold, thy mother! stands in stark contrast to this. It is broken, weak, and the sounds of hammering can be heard in the strings. I think it goes without saying that this movement is all a matter of perspective on the situation, the first being from the mother’s standpoint, and the last from Jesus’s. The third movement was good, but for me, not as impactful as the others. Same for the fourth and fifth. The sixth opens with these striking chords, presumably the nails into the cross. The last movement is very serene and peaceful. I think that overall this is a super effective piece of music. It felt a little empty at times, but this is truly a programmatic piece. There were points where the pauses served to heighten the impact of the moment through either contemplation, exasperation, or other such emotions. I enjoyed this piece a lot, although the first movement is definitely my favorite. Super powerful.",
"Darcy is a Canadian jazz composer and bandleader. He studied at McGill University before finishing his education at the NEC. He has won numerous awards for his contemporary jazz compositions, and he is best known for his work with the eighteen piece jazz ensemble, Secret Society. This piece was written in 2003 and won the BMI (Broadcast Music Inc.) Charlie Parker Composition Prize. All I have to say is that this tune slaps. It grooves really hard the whole way through, and it is just really fun to listen to. Looking at the score, I noticed that it behaves like a blend between jazz and contemporary styles. The form isn’t what is normally expected in a jazz chart, the colors employed are more akin to classical practices, and the score layout is unlike any jazz chart I have ever seen. Definitely a fascinating piece, and I will certainly be using aspects of it in my own writing.",
"The book I’m reading, The Gesualdo Hex by Glenn Watkins, seeks to draw parallels between Gesualdo an Schoenberg as well as Stravinksy. He proposes that all three composers were on the cusp of a transitional period in music, and as such, one can see such parallels clearly. The case of this piece is explored on a more microscopic scale, however, in regards to its place in his opus. It was written in 1936, after he had fled to America from Germany. The work is serialist, a point the Leibowitz (a correspondent of Schoenberg and fierce advocate of the Second Viennese School) clearly praised, yet the Chamber Symphony Number 2 which was to follow shows a trend back towards the tonal. Leibowitz criticised this movement, for it broke from the necessary and innate progression towards serialism that Shoenberg had initiated, but Schoenberg didn’t view his creations as a necessary endeavor of progress. In all fairness, Leibowitz did acknowledge this contradiction clearly, although, it doesn’t change his opinion. As Watkins stated, Donning the hat of the historian, he [Leibowitz] argues that just as there were traces of modality that lingered in the transition to so- called tonal music, so traces of tonality and other archaisms can be expected to appear in the movement towards an atonal and ultimately dodecaphonic world. Leibowitzs reasoning reflects an almost compulsive need to review the period of Gesualdo and Monteverdi- the crossover period from modality to tonality, as a prelude to Schoenbergs achievements. (103) I will argue, however, that not every composer’s work will fit into the neat little box that critics wish for. Whatever the case is with this piece and how it relates to the Chamber Symphony Number 2, I am still interested to listen to it.  I didn’t make it through the whole piece, but I listened to enough of it to know that it is definitely Serialist.",
"This comes per recommendation from Ross. Soufjan, meaning comes with a sword, is an American musician and multi- instrumentalist. He attended Interlochen before getting his MFA from the New School in New York. He then founded a record label, Asthmatic Kitty, with his stepfather. His debut album, A Sun Came, was released in 1999, and he has received critical acclaim for his work ever since. His music is somewhat hard to categorize, as it changes from album to album and even track to track, but he has been described as indie folk, alternative rock, indie rock, indie pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, folk pop, avant-garde folk, lo-fi folk, and electronica. This album, released in 2001, is often described as being electronica. It is his second album, and it is a concept album/ song cycle which follows each animal of the Chinese Zodiac. The only exception is the last track, Year of Our Lord, which references his Christian faith (a common theme in many of his albums). Overall it was a pretty wild album. There wits hints of melodic context at times, but in a more general sense, I think the album focused more on textural and timbral explorations. Definitely interesting, and I will be checking out some more of his stuff some time.",
"This album comes recommended from Dylan. Flatsound is a project created by a guy named Mitch Welling from California in 2007. He is severely agoraphobic, and didnt leave his apartment for nearly ten years. He writes and records music as a means of healing, which is why his canon is surprisingly large. This album was released in 2009, and it is his first album under the Flatsound project name. The overall sound of the album is what I would call subdued chaos. I have to imagine that is what having agoraphobia is like. The very nature of the condition is subdued, yet Im certain there is an almost unbearable degree of intensity behind the curtains. A cool album that I really enjoyed listening to.",
"The first of what is sure to be many pieces from the Sampson Studio listening list. This first piece is by Anton Webern, an Austrian Composer of the second Viennese School. A student of Schoenberg and colleague of Berg, it is not surprising that he became an exponent of Serialism and the Twelve Tone Technique developed by his mentor. His usage of the concept; however, is far more radical than the other two. He sought to serialize nearly all aspects of music, including pitch, rhythm, register, timbre, dynamics, articulation, and melodic contour. Webern was an interesting character when it came to WWII. On many accounts he detested the Nazi Party and hid away many Jewish friends from their search. Later letters; however, seem to indicate a cooled attitude towards the Nazi Party and Hitler. He was also known to make Anti- Semetic statement, even towards his old teacher Schoenberg. Even in spite of this, Schoenberg’s Violin Concerto continued to bear a dedication to Webern, although it was widdled down over time to avoid drawing Nazi attention to him. He shot and killed in 1945 by and American soldier, who later succumbed to remorse and died of alcoholism. This piece was composed in 1909, shortly after he had graduated from Vienna University. Each movement is short, yet the work represents a turning point in his opus. It is said that many of his unique idiosyncrasies begin to first take shape here, and they can be seen manifesting themselves in later works. Each movement has its own unique character, but I enjoyed movement four the most. It sounded almost as if he was dovetailing timbres into each other, giving the whole piece an almost serene type of feel. This was undercut by the rolling timpani underneath, which brought the piece to a rousing climax unlike any of the other movements. Overall a pretty cool piece though, and I look forward to hearing more of his work.",
"So Dr. Deemer mentioned this cat in Instrumentation yesterday when we were discussing the Hornbostel Sachs classification, specifically Natural Aerophones. Steve is a jazz trombonist who teaches at MSM and Julliard, has recorded many albums, and is also the trombonist on the Saturday Night Live band. He is best known for pioneering the use of Conch shells as instruments. In this Miles Davis tune from Kind of Blue, he does a solo opening on Conch, plays the head, and then proceeds to freaking solo on a conch shell. Its pretty goddamn amazing. He has multiple shells, each presumably with a different range. The thing that sticks out to me about this whole performance is just how amazing the timbre of the shell is. It sounds almost like a trumpet with harmon mute, but without a lot the edge and harshness of the sound. It makes me want to find a Conch shell and start messing around with it. I also wonder if he had to specially select certain shells for their tuning, or if that is something he has to adjust for. It doesn’t sound like the band is tuning to him, so I’m guessing it one of the first two hypothesis. And as if soloing on a Conch shell wasn’t enough, he does it on two at the same time. I want one, and I want to hear this live. Humanity is pretty incredible sometimes. A side thought- Part of how he changes pitch is by moving his hand in and out of the conch shell. I imagine that mental map is like the slide positions of a trombone, but since he switches between conch shells all the time, he must have to be constantly be readjusting that map. And then two at the same time. Damn.",
"This piece (translated to expectation), composed in 1909, is a modernist monodrama (an operatic piece with a single character). Schoenberg had this to say of the piece: In Erwartung the aim is to represent in slow motion everything that occurs during a single second of maximum spiritual excitement, stretching it out to half an hour. The story is as follows: A woman is in an apprehensive state as she searches for her lover. In the darkness, she comes across what she first thinks is a body, but then realises is a tree-trunk. She is frightened and becomes more anxious as she cannot find the man she is looking for. She then finds a dead body, and sees that it is her lover. She calls out for assistance, but there is no response. She tries to revive him, and addresses him as if he were still alive, angrily charging him with being unfaithful to her. She then asks herself what she is to do with her life, as her lover is now dead. Finally, she wanders off alone into the night. The piece is atonal and athematic, meaning there are no recognizable themes. The only thing linking the piece together is the dramatic scene being described. Despite this, the music does not feel nearly as disparate and strange as I had expected. The harmonies and rhythms he used are very effective at creating such an unsettling and mysterious sonic atmosphere. Obviously no themes are present, yet I almost find myself unable to reconcile with that fact. The piece still feels incredibly unified and interesting to listen to despite lacking nearly everything which I though to be fundamental in creating a memorable work. That’s not to say that a work without melody or harmony will be unmemorable, but I think that those things have a time and a place within a larger context. I think this piece entirely represents that larger context; it is memorable in a totally different sense of the word. Because the entire work is devoid of those elements, the listener is forced to focus solely on the emotions being portrayed. Super interesting. I would love to learn more about the compositional process behind this piece. It is obviously atonal and athematic, but I’m certain that he must have had a process when determining what to write. There certainly appears to be a rhyme and reason to what I am hearing.",
"I picked back up the Gesualdo Hex today, and it tied in nicely with my listening from this week. The book is currently exploring Schoenberg’s works in the early 20th Century, namely trying to justify the rapid shift in style. Watkins justifies it by saying, Indeed, one of the most powerful admissions Schoenberg ever made was that he was haunted by the prospect of unexcavated territory between the language of the Chamber Symphony, Opus  9 (1906), and Erwartung, Opus  17 (1909). (109) Schoenberg retroactively corroborated this statement when he said, In other words, as I have already said so often: every composer of a new style has a feeling to return to the old style (as did Beethoven in the fugue). The harmonic language of the Organ- Variations fills in the space between my Chamber Symphony, Opus  9 and the dissonant music. (108) Since I just listened to Erwartung and quite enjoyed it, I decided I would explore this topic a bit further. This piece was composed in 1909, and it is a prime example of the use of quartal harmony. It is listed as one movement, but Schoenberg has it laid out as five continuous movements. Listening to the piece, one can tell that it is clearly tonal. It certainly doesn’t sound like a Mozart Symphony, but it is much more Late Romantic than Early Serialist. Comparing this piece with Erwartung is nearly night and day in many regards, which is I suppose why Leibowitz was so interested in the matter. A drastic change in a composer’s style normally doesn’t happen over the course of three years (unless, of course, we consider political motivations). It is fascinating to see this changed marked purely by creative ambition, but I suppose that is to be expected from a trailblazer such as Schoenberg. Less dramatic examples of this contrast can too be seen in other transitional figures, such as Beethoven and, of course, Gesualdo (although his transformation took a lifetime to come to full fruition). Next is to fill in the gap between this piece and Erwartung with Schoenberg’s Organ- Variations.",
"Oddly enough, I could not find the Organ Variations Schoenberg was referring to. He did write a set of Organ Variations on a recitative, but its composition wasn’t started until the 1940’s. I’m rather stumped as to why this is. It’s something I will have to ask Professor Sampson about. So I settled for the next closest thing I could find, a set of three piano pieces (that is the literal translation). They were written in 1909, and they supposedly represent a divergence from his earlier tonal style to the atonal. That they are this is apparent, yet I can still hear some lingerings of tonality left within them. Many of the pieces have a clear melodic contour, or at least, melodic elements within them. Melody obviously isn’t tonality, but through years of common practice and cultural association, the two are generally linked. Overall a pretty cool piece with an interesting wandering type of sound, but I still wish I could find those organ variations!",
"Back to the Sampson listening list. All of Bartok’s string quartets are listed, but I am only going to listen to one of them to start. I will hopefully begin filling in the other five over the course of the year. Last semester I listened to his piece The Miraculous Mandarin and really enjoyed it, but I need a little refresher on who he was! He was a Hungarian composer, and along with Franz Liszt, they are regarded as the country’s greatest. He is often considered to be one of the most important composers of the 20th century, as his influence is still felt today. He also worked a lot with folk music, and his concept of Comparative Musicology later became the modern day Ethnomusicology. I found it interesting to read that he was good friends with Zoltan Kodaly, who developed the Kodaly System of music education that is still used today. His fourth String Quartet seemed to be the most popular on Google, so I am going to start with that one. It was composed in September of 1928 while he was in Budapest. The piece is in five movements and has an arch structure, where the first relates to the fifth, the second to fourth, and the third stands on its own. I have heard it proposed that The Planets by Holst also has this structure, where Jupiter is the keystone. I will definitely be listening for connections! This piece also makes use of many extended techniques, including Bartok or Snap Pizzicato. Interestingly enough, a lot of this piece reminds me of sections from George Crumb’s Black Angels. I am still astounded by the sheer variety of timbres that can be produced on string instruments. I would generally describe the first movement as percussive. The second movement used a lot of pizz. and arpeggios, giving it a sound that nearly crawled. The third movement is much more subdued and lyrical, featuring solo cello for a large part of the movement and an Unanswered Question- esque chorale in the background. The middle section does change style a little bit, but the departure is brief. I am guessing that this divergence towards the middle is a microscopic reflection of the macroscopic form. The fourth movement uses pizz. strings almost exclusively, thus reflecting those tendencies of the second movement. For obvious reasons, it reminded me of Ravel’s String Quartet, Movement II. The final movement could again be described as generally percussive, thus finishing the archlike reflection of form. A super cool piece that I would definitely listen to again.",
"I’m very excited for this piece, especially since I haven’t listened to any Ives since I’ve been in college. He was an American Modernist Composer and Actuary. He started composing at a young age and continued to do so until around 1927, where he mysteriously stopped composing until his death in 1954 (nearly the same thing happened to Sibelius). His work went largely unrecognized during his life, but later people recognized the quality of his music. He was one of the first composers to regularly write experimental music, and as such he was of great influence to other experimentalist composers at the beginning of the 20th century and beyond. He attended Yale and studied composition before moving to New York City, where he stayed until he died. He also wrote the book Life Insurance with Relation to Inheritance Tax, which laid the groundwork for estate planning and gained him great renown within that field. This piece was written around 1915, but he went back and revised it during his silent period in 1947. This is the version which is most frequently performed today. The sonata is in four movements, and each represents a central figure in the transcendentalist movement of the late 1820’s and 30’s. Since these figures (Emerson, Hawthorne, Alcott, and Thoreau) were largely based out of Concord Massachusetts, the sonata was later named as such. As a refresher, transcendentalism was philosophical movement which arose in reaction to intellectualism and spirituality, and it believes in the inherent goodness of people. The concepts of self- reliance, nature, and complete originality were of great significance to these thinkers. The thing that stuck out to me most in the first movement was the constant reference to Beethoven Five. My guess is that this was because Beethoven was somewhat of a revolutionary himself, and he adored the ideas of freedom, liberty, and self- reliance. In all honesty, I can’t make it through the rest of this piece. It is an effective work, but it is hard to listen to.",
"David Lang is a living American composer based out of New York City. He cofounded Bang on a Can, and he also won a Pulitzer Prize for The Little Match Girl Passion. One of his teachers was also Lou Harisson. This piece, written in 2011, is a ten minute soliloquy for solo piaNumber It was written quite literally by hand when David realized he had spent the prior decade writing entirely on a computer. This piece is definitely minimalist at its core. I liked how it seemed to almost fall apart at the end. Overall a cool piece, but I think the large majority of interest falls upon its context in his output.",
"This album came up in conversation with my friend Maddy last night, so I decided to check it out. I know my dad was a big fan of this group, but outside of that, I don’t know much of anything about them. They were a group formed in London in 1977, and included Sting (lead vocals, bass guitar, primary songwriter), Andy Summers (guitar) and Stewart Copeland (drums, percussion). They were a key group in the Second British Invasion, another surge of British musical culture in America during the 1980’s (preceded by the initial British Invasion of the mid 1960’s). They were a key example of  the new-wave scene (a style of popular music emerging in the late 70’s which found roots less in blues and more in disco and electronic music), as they played a style of rock influenced by punk, reggae, and jazz. They had many hits before disbanding in 1986 to pursue solo careers, including Message in a Bottle, Every Little Thing She Does is Magic, and Every Breath You Take. The last one is off this album, their last studio album release in 1983. Much of the album is based on the book The Roots of Coincidence by Arthur Koestler. The book explores  extrasensory perception and psychokinesis, as well as Carl Jung’s idea of synchronicity ( events are meaningful coincidences if they occur with no causal relationship yet seem to be meaningfully related). I wouldn’t have necessarily guessed this overarching theme, but I also haven’t dug into the lyrics of any of the songs yet (something which I plan to do later tonight). The album represents a decreased reggae influence present in their earlier albums, instead relying more on synthesizers and world genres. This is certainly present in listening to the album. They sound a bit like Genesis, but with a more pop/ rock feel. I suspect that a lot of the music around this time sounds sort of similar, since they were at the top of the musical world at the time, and the style of the 80’s is generally pretty distinct. I definitely like this album, and I will definitely be checking out more of their stuff pretty soon! I also really liked the last tune, Murder By Numbers. Super cool piece.",
"Time for some Morton Feldman, as I am starting to experiment with indeterminate music in my string quartet. Feldman was an American Composer who was active during the mid 20th century. He was involved with the experimentalist scene, which is often associated with other New York City composers. In particular, he met John Cage in a lobby after Anton Webern’s First Symphony. They quickly became friends, and it was through Cage that Feldman met other figures such as Henry Cowell, Virgil Thomson, and even Jackson Pollock. He also held a position at SUNY Buffalo, where he taught for quite a few years before he died. He is known for developing novel approaches to notation, incorporating aleatory and indeterminacy into his music, as well as writing slowly developing music which later grew into pieces lasting hours on end. This piece was written in 1982, only five years before his death. It is a homage to his friends Philip Guston (a painter) and Frank O’Hara (a poet, among many other things), and it is dedicated to Joan La Barbara (a virtuosic contemporary singer who introduced many extended singing techniques; she also studied at Syracuse University). The work consists of three soprano parts, one live and two prerecorded. Alternatively, three live voices can be used. The piece is, in a word, mesmerizing. Each voice is panned differently (left, right, and center), and as such, the distinction between each is very clear. One can focus in on a single voice and hear only their line. Taken as a whole, however, is where the interesting part begins. Sometimes, if one says a word too many times, they begin to hear it as something else. The instantaneous association our brain makes with certain combinations of sounds known as words is lost, and the word suddenly becomes strange sounds. In a sense, this is what is happening with this piece. There is no text, however, the timbre is shaded differently in my head as I listen to more of the piece. I am only on movement two, and I already feel as though I am not listening to a human voice. It sounds so strangely foreign. My other observation about this piece is its length. It is just under an hour long, yet the content Feldman is working with is incredibly minimal. In that regard it reminds me of John Luther Adams’s Become Ocean or Become Desert, or in a more broad sense, a plethora of minimalist/ post- minimalist/ totalist works. In terms of my string quartet, I think I need to allow things much more time to unfold. I might double the length of everything. Certainly an interesting poem. I read it as someone who is stuck in their own head without escape. They are stuck in a crystal ball with only snow, contained completely, and he finds a sense of beauty in that. But then the wind picks up, and the snow whirls in fatal winds, unable to escape. The snow falls back down, and he is changed as a result. His bear is his beast, and the beauty has been replaced with the evil which he now loves. The only line used from the poem is that snow falls, which I feel completely sums up the meaning of the poem. I would almost venture to make the argument that the vocal lines, striving outwards yet always falling back down into dissonances, are representative of the containment described in the poem. In any case, I love the added meaning this little discovery created!",
"The Police reminded me of this album for obvious reasons. My dad used to have it on vinyl, but I’ve never listened to it. The group was formed in 1973 in Illinois, and over the years has had many changes in members. Lead guitarist Rick Neilsen is the only original member. They were a hit first in Japan, but broke into the US Mainstream in 1979. Their name arose at a Slade concert, where Petersson commented that the band used every cheap trick in the book as part of their act. This album was their fourth studio album and one of their most commercially successful. It was completed in early 1979, but release was postponed until September of the same year due to the unexpected success of Cheap Trick at Budokan (a live recording of one of the Japan concerts that gained them mainstream popularity. It had been named one of the greatest albums of all time). Dream Police represents an expansion of their previous style, as they explored more complex orchestrations and longer form tracks. The eponymous first track is definitely a recognizable tune, and I really enjoyed it. Overall a pretty cool album!",
"Time for some Nadia. I listened to a lot of her sister, Lili’s, music last year, but I think this is the first I’ve listened to Nadia’s. She was a French Composer and pianist, though her work as an educator is where she gains most of her fame. She taught many leading composers of the 20th century, including  Aaron Copland, Roy Harris, Virgil Thomson, Darius Milhaud, Elliott Carter, Daniel Barenboim, John Eliot Gardiner, Philip Glass, Lalo Schifrin, Astor Piazzolla, and Quincy Jones. She studied at the Paris Conservatory under Faure, and she continued to educate until her death in 1979 (she was born in 1887). She gave up composition in the 1920’s, claiming that she only wrote useless music. This stands in stark contrast to the fact that she entered the Paris Conservatory at age nine. She almost won the Prix de Rome, but she came in second after Sain Saens tried to have her disqualified for writing an instrumental instead of vocal fugue (many see this as a case of sexism). Her sister Lili later became the first woman to win the prize. Nadia saw her as the first important female composer, and vehemently supported her works after her untimely death.  This piece was composed in 1914 for cello and piaNumber Although she didn’t see much renown during her time as a composer (a sentiment she supported, even in spite of its sexist grounding), the piece represents a vital piece of her legacy. The first movement is a stunningly beautiful piece of music, as is the second movement, The third movement stands in stark contrast to the rest, although it is still a very good piece of music. I feel as though I can hear the influence of Faure in this piece.",
"Kaija is a Female Finnish Composer who is currently still alive (so yes, quite possibly one of the most unnecessarily niche composers I have listened to yet!). She was born in Helsinki, but she studied in Paris under Brian Ferneyhough and now lives there. She works with the IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique, or Institute for Research and Coordination in Acoustics/Music in English), which is an organization dedicated to studying the science behind avant garde electro- acoustical art music. It was this organization which pioneered many of the technologies which made Spectralism possible, such as Fast Fourier Transforms and special microphones which could isolate each of a cello’s four string. It was here that she also experimented with musique concrete, which uses raw recordings as compositional material. She is also a synthestite, and like Michael Torke, a lot of her works are attempts to represent things she sees in the world around her. Her works often combine live instruments and electronics. This piece, which translates as Crystal, was written in 1989 for orchestra and live electronics. Her website states that the piece is all about dissecting the initial chord into all of its various components. The thing which strikes me most about this piece is how seamlessly the synthesizer fits into the rest of the orchestra. I almost didn’t realize it was there at first, but a few featured moments inevitably gave it away. This piece is another which is very different from the type of writing I do, as it prioritizes the definition an atmosphere over everything else. A super cool piece of music, I definitely want to check out more of her stuff. I may have to ask Professor Sampson for a few recommendations!",
"Time for some Berg. This will officially complete the triangle of the Second Viennese School, as he too was a student of Schoenberg. He combined Romantic Lyricism with the the Twelve- Tone serial techniques developed by Schoenberg, giving him a very unique sound. He died on Christmas Eve in 1935 at age fifty of an infected furuncle caused by an insect bite. He is best known for his opera Wozzeck, although he has many other popular works. This piece, composed before Wozzeck in 1913, is one of those works. It is an orchestral piece with medium voice based on the text of postcards written by his friend and poet Peter Altenberg (hence the title). The text deals with complicated condition of the soul, and the work is in five movements. It is also worth mentioning the premiere. It was conducted by his teacher Schoenberg, and the program also included Webern’s Six Pieces for Orchestra, Alexander von Zemlinsky’s Four Orchestral Songs on poems by Maeterlinck, Schoenberg’s First Chamber Symphony, as well as Mahler’s Kindertotenlieder. The Mahler, however, was never performed, as the crowd erupted into a riot fueled by distaste with the expressionist music before them. One of the Concert Go-ers punched the concert organizer, and someone commented that it was the most harmonious sound of the evening. The event came to be known as the Skandalkonzert, and it foreshadowed the Rite of Spring riot only two months later. Overall a pretty wild piece of music. The text was really cool, and I think the music did a good job of reflecting the wandering, existential dread described. Really awesome. I definitely feel as though listening to this type of music is expanding my ears a bit.",
"I don’t remember exactly how I heard about this piece, but I think it may have been through So Percussion. Lukas is a composer and percussionist who teaches composition at the University of California. The piece, written for solo marimba, was premiered in 2015 with four different marimbists on each of five movements. One of them is Eric Cha- Beach, one of the lovely members of So Percussion, so now I am certain where I heard of this piece from. The first movement was very interesting in its usage of two different types of mallets of distinct hardnesses. This lent itself to very distinct timbres coming from a single marimba. The third movement was a four part invention, and that was pretty insane. Some really complex polyrhythms in that one! The fourth movement Scherzo used fixed marimba, and I thought that was pretty cool. The final movement, a two part invention, was also pretty amazing. Overall, a very impressive piece!",
"I got to meet Georgia this week through my work with Ethos, and after hearing the concert on Wednesday, I had to listen to this piece again. Every piece was really good, but this piece in particular hit pretty hard. Georgia is a composer, lyricist, and collaborator who has worked on various shows on Broadway. She founded the group Maestra which works to connect the small number of female composers on Broadway, and her husband is the well- known Jason Robert Brown. This piece was composed in 2013 for the musical Danger Year. It is a story about loss, and it is just really powerful for obvious reasons. I definitely prefer the version with a more fleshed out instrumentation (piano, set, and bass). The other songs of hers I really enjoyed, for future reference, include Not Yet, Stop, More of My Mother, and Sing Me a Happy Song.",
"More Lili! I always get excited when I see her music pop up in my YouTube recommendations. I could not find any information on this piece other than that it was composed in 1912. The title translates as Suns of September, and it is for mixed choir and piaNumber It is such a beautiful piece. The way she writes for piano sounds almost like an orchestra. I love her music so much. It’s all just so beautiful. It always makes me sad that she died so young. To think of the incredible pieces she may have written!",
"Derek recommended I listen to this group after a studio session last week. I went to there Spotify and picked an album at random. They are a trio from the University of Southern California, and this is their 2012 debut album. They describe their sound as fusion alternative R&B and neo- soul. This album is pretty hip and has a super unique sound. I will definitely be checking out more of their work!",
"Mickie played us a song from this album last night, so I decided to give it a listen. It is definitely way out of my comfort zone, but I figured it was as good a place as any to break into the genre. Kendrick is an American rapper and record producer who is considered to be one of the most successful hip hop artists of all time. This album, released in 2017, was his fourth studio album. Most notably, it was the first non- classical or jazz piece to win the Pulitzer Prize. I remember that some people were pretty pissed about that, but they just need to get over themselves. The album is pretty cool. It is most often described as Conscious Rap, a subgenre of hip hop characterized by political awareness which arose in the 1980’s. I think the whole album is really interesting in this regard, as outside of people like Shosty, Prokofiev, and Rweski, I haven’t heard a ton of politically charged music, especially not about current issues. It is somewhat of a harsh paradigm shift, as the album suddenly feels like a political platform as well as an artistic medium. I don’t think this is something I would like to introduce into my music, but it is certainly interesting nonetheless. There are a couple tunes that groove pretty hard, and oddly enough, this is an album I can see myself listening to for casual entertainment. Totally out of my comfort zone and cultural circle, but it is still a super cool work. I have a lot of respect for it, and I am looking forward to exploring more of his work as well as other artists within the genre.",
"Brandon suggested I give this piece a listen, since he is trying to record it on the King organ. Since I started work on a piece for organ today, it also seems like appropriate timing. It was a pretty interesting piece. It definitely has that Baroque flare about it. A little different from the piece I am writing, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. Brandon is going to have a hard time programming this interpretation!",
"I was reading an article today on New Music USA about a new album commemorating the National Parks, and I was surprised to find both Dr. Deemer as well as David Biedenbender on the list of collaborators. I recognized David because we played this piece in ACB last semester. David is a composer based out of Michigan, where he both studied and now teaches. This piece was composed in 2009, and it is based off Johan Schop melody Break Forth O Beauteous Heavenly Light which was subsequently harmonized and arranged by Bach. It is really interesting to listen to them side by side. You can hear fragments of the original melody, but he has transformed them pretty significantly to make something new. Cool piece.",
"Since I am writing a piece for organ, I decided I would look up some organ music that is post- Bach. I googled organ music, and this guy was the first result. I have never heard of him, but it seems as though he was well connected. Charles was a French Organist and Composer from the mid 19th century to early mid 20th century. He held many prestigious organ posts in France under people such as Saint- Saens and Charle Gonoud. He also took over Cesar Frank’s organ teaching position at the Paris Conservatoire when he died in 1890. Widor then had quite a few famous students, including Darius Milhaud and Edgard Varese. He also founded the American Conservatory at  Fontainebleau with Francis-Louis Casadesus. He was director until Ravel took his position in 1934, and he taught alongside many other famous composers including Maurice Ravel, Camille Saint-Saëns, Igor Stravinsky, Arthur Rubinstein, Leonard Bernstein, Nadia Boulanger, and many others (including some people from the spectral school). It was from this conservatory that many of the most prominent 20th century musicians emerged, including Aaron Copland and others. Today, Widor is best known for his ten organ symphonies. This one, composed in 1879, is his best known work, in particular the last movement (a toccata often used in Christmas celebrations). Overall a super cool piece of music. I’m not horribly familiar with the organ, but I was impressed with the range of dynamics and colors available. It has made me realize that I either need to get into King to screw around with the organ a bit, or more likely, do a shit ton of research on the whole thing. The other thing I noticed is just how much control there is over transience with the organ. Some stops produce a timbre that just sort of melts into itself, whereas other stops produce a relatively clear melodic line. This is certainly something to mess around with on my piece, as I have a lot of different options at my disposable apparently. I really enjoyed this work, and it has certainly given me a lot to think about!",
"Time for some Stravinsky. I cannot recall if I have listened to any of his stuff since I started college, so I will do a brief summary of him as I do with the others. He was a Russian Born composer who saw immense success in Europe and the United States as one of the most influential composers of the 20th century. He first saw success with the three operas commissioned by Serge Diaghilev of the Ballet Russes- The Firebird (1910), Petrushka (1911), and The Rite of Spring (1913). Stravinsky was very close with Rimsky Kosakov from a young age, as he took private lessons from him. It was he who urged him not to enter the St. Petersburg Conservatory. If he had, I wonder if he would have met Prokofiev. He initially moved to Switzerland from Russia after the success of Firebird, before moving to France and then the United States after the outbreak of WWII. He spent most of his life living in West Hollywood. His musical career is often divided into three periods, the Russian period (c. 1907–1919), the Neoclassical period (c. 1920–1954), and the Serial period (1954–1968). This piece, composed in 1955, falls into his final serial period. The piece was composed specifically to be performed in Saint Marks Basilica in Venice. As Watkins points out in The Gesualdo Hex, this specific arrangement reflected Stravinsky’s deep interest in music of the past. This is one of those illogical loops discussed, where the pursuit of the new often reflects as a reaching back for the old. In particular, Stravinsky was interested in the music of Andrea Gabrieli, his nephew Giovanni Gabrieli, and Claudio Monteverdi- specifically their use of canon and antiphonal/ polychoral textures in their music. Many of these elements are reflected in the serial Canticum. The piece is in five movements (like the five domes of the St. Marks), the second of which was his first to make use of an entire tone row, and it is scored for orchestra and mixed choir. Stravinsky was also very deliberate in the programming of other pieces at the premiere, as he wanted them to reflect the nature of the piece he had composed. Included were other works by Gabrieli and Monteverdi. He initially wanted a piece by Gesualdo, but the request was denied because he never had any Venetian connections. This work was foreshadowed by his arrangement of Bach’s lesser known Organ Variations on Vom Himmel Hoch. Certainly Leibowitz would have frowned upon this piece, but like Schoenberg, Stravinsky showed no interest in the alleged linearity of music history. The whole piece is also in arch form, with the final fifth movement being a near exact retrograde of the first. The opening movement is pretty intense. Watkins says that Stravinsky was emulating Monteverdi’s stile concitato (agitated style) with the sixteenth notes in the trumpets, as well as the juxtaposition of slower tempo sections. The second movement is very obviously making use of a tone row, yet the style of composition is still reminiscent to that of the late 16th century. Overall a really wild piece. I think I like it more for it’s history than the music itself, but there is still value in that for sure. It is a fascinating discussion of the influences the past have on the present.",
"Time for some Franck. I have heard the name before, but I am not familiar with his work at all. He was a composer and organist alive during the better part of the 19th century. He was born in modern day Belgium, but he spent most of his time studying and teaching in Paris (first at Sainte-Clotilde, Paris, and then later the Paris Conservatoire). H was in a similar situation to Beethoven, in that his father forced him into music with the expectation that he would make their family wealthy. He later grew to resent this toxic relationship and cut off all relations with them. He is best known for his organ works, which have since become a staple of the repertoire. This piece was composed in 1860, and it the largest work from his set of Six Pièces pour Grand Orgue. The piece is one movement, but it is often thought of as three distinct sections. It is also the work which many consider to foreshadow his later career, as it was one of the first works he composed after his failed opera Le Valet de ferme paralyzed his compositional activity for years. The first thing that stands out to me about watching a recording of the performance is that the number of manuals available is a huge consideration when composing for organ. This particular organ has five, whereas the King organ only has two. It seems as though there are in fact pedals to adjust the volume, and since I saw stops moving on their own, I am guessing there is some sort of switch that allows one to preset certain timbres. I will definitely have to look into all of these things. The other thing I noticed from a technique standpoint is the number of times he had to switch out fingers while sustaining a note. I would imagine this is necessary since there isn’t any sustain on the organ when a key isn’t being depressed (like the pedal on a piano). I will have to ask someone how common this is. Overall, a super cool piece. I really enjoyed the use of timbre throughout, and it is definitely going to be a consideration in my piece. I really enjoyed the fugue during the third section.",
"Time for some more music by Sarah Kirkland Snider. I listened to her album Unremembered last year and really enjoyed, so with comp forum presentations approaching, I thought I would check out more of her stuff. She was born and raised in New Jersey before receiving her B.A. from Wesleyan University and her M.M. and Artist Diploma from the Yale School of Music. She is known for combining indie- rock and folk music elements with aspects of contemporary classical chamber music. She is also the co- director of New Amsterdam Records, which specializes in promoting classically trained musicians who fall between traditional genre boundaries. This album, released in 2010 under the very same label, is one of her best known works. It is an orchestral song cycle in fourteen movements which follows Odysseuss wife from Homers epic of the same name. Ensemble Signal played the orchestral arrangements. It received widespread critical success for its ability to seamlessly combine two genres. Overall a pretty beautiful album. I couldnt really pick out all the lyrics (since Im bad at that), but it was still super affecting. It reminds me a lot of Unremembered.",
"Graham suggested I check out this album, so I want to listen to it on my sound system before I head back to Fred. Thile is an American Mandolinist and Composer known best for his work with the progressive bluegrass trio Nickel Creek as well as the quintet Punch Brothers. He is also a 2012 MacArthur Fellow. Mehldau is an American Jazz Pianist and composer. He studied at the New School in New York City, and he has played with many jazz chamber ensembles as well as solo. This album was released in 2017. It was pretty awesome. I like how the mandolin often took on a rather percussive role at times. It felt like a trio more than duet at times. Super cool. I definitely want to check out Punch Brothers and more of Mehldau.",
"One of the violinists from Mivos recommended this album to me after I mentioned that I was working on a piece for organ. I can’t find a ton of information on Ellen other than that she was born in 1990 and hails from Sweden. Her Spotify says that she works a lot with Just Intonation (something I am going to have to spend more time learning about), and her compositions tend to be long form soundscapes. This album was released in 2017, and it is for Renaissance Organ, Horn, Trombone, and Microtonal Tuba. From what I understand, Renaissance Organs were tuned with Pythagorean Tuning (a form of Just Intonation). As I said, I need to look into it more. I really enjoyed the music. I listened while working on stuff for the Composer Diversity Database. It is really atmospheric, and my ears adjusted to the tuning pretty quickly.",
"My Uncle Mark recommended me this album, so I decided to give it a listen. I have heard quite a few of the tracks already, but never the whole album in its entirety. Led Zeppelin was an English rock band formed in 1968 with Robert Plant, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones, and John Bonham. Page initially came from the group The Yardbirds, which was also responsible fro launching the careers of Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck. He changed their name to the New Yardbirds before then settling on Led Zeppelin (a name taken from the Who, who had remarked on the lead balloon of a group that had played some sessions earlier on. Lead was changed to Led to avoid confusion). This change marked the end of the Yardbirds for twenty four years, but they eventually reunited with different members. Led Zeppelin saw massive success in the 70’s, and many claimed that they had as much influence during that decade as the Beatles had in the 60’s. Along with Black Sabbath and Deep Purple, they are often considered to be one of the founders of Heavy Metal. They are one of the most successful bands in the history of music. Plant generally wrote music, while Page supplied lyrics. In 1980, John Boham died from alcohol induced asphyxiation, and the band broke up as a result. They have had numerous reunions over the years, but their eight albums remain their biggest legacy. This album was their first, released in 1969. It was self produced by Page, and the whole thing was completed in thirty six hours. It was well received by audiences, but some major media sources didn’t take so well to it. Rolling Stone vilified it, even though they now list it as #29 on the 500 greatest albums of all time. Every age hears a previous music anew through contemporary experience… (Watkins 7) Right away, the blues influence is incredibly apparent. Many of the song as just straight twelve bar form, but the heavy drumming and guitar playing give it a unique hard rock edge. I like this album a lot.",
"Derrick recommended me these cats. They are a jazz trio from Minnesota which specializes in Avant- Garde Jazz. They are best known for their arrangements of popular tunes in a different style. This album, released in 2014, is their crack at Stravinsky’s famous ballet. I didn’t like this as much as I thought I was going to. The whole thing felt more like an arrangement of Rite of Spring rather than an interpretation of the work by Jazz Trio. That isn’t to say that it didn’t work, but it felt much more like a contemporary chamber ensemble piece than something for a Jazz Trio. Very talented people, but not what I was expecting.",
"Joseph presented on a few of the tunes from this album yesterday, so I thought I would check it out. AAL is a progressive instrumental metal band formed by Nigerian American guitarist Tosin Abasi in 2007. It also consists of guitarist Javier Reyes and Matt Garstka. They are often considered to be one of the key djent artists. Djent is a subgenre of progressive metal (progressive rock and heavy metal hybrid) which is onomatopeia for the distinctive high-gain, distorted, palm-muted, low-pitch guitar sound. It characterized by rhythmic and technical complexity over an underlying polyphonic groove. It developed out of Sweden in the mid 90’s and has since grown into a live phenomenon through development by online bedroom musicians. I have heard the term but never the music, so I am excited to see what it sounds like. This album, released in 2011, is their second studio album. It features the trio line up for the first time, with both Abasi and Reyes on eight string electric guitars (two lower strings added beneath low E string). The album is based off chapters in science fiction novel Rendevous with Rama by Arthur Clarke, which depicts humankind’s first contact with an alien craft. Overall a pretty cool album. Not exactly my thing, but I certainly enjoyed it more than other heavy metal I have listened to.",
"I read an analysis of Amy Beach’s synesthesia a few days ago, and this piece was mentioned explicitly. In the study, the writer seeks to link some of Amy Beach’s colored compositions to traits found within color psychology. She related Eb major, the key of this work, with the color pink. In color psychology, pink is often associated with nurture, warmth, love, femininity, love, and sexuality. The text of this piece, written by Beach herself, seems to reflect these traits.",
"Graham recommended this album to me, and since I had heard of Mars Volta but never listened to their music, I decided to check it out. They are a progressive rock group formed out of El Paso Texas in 2001. They were largely a result of the breakup of the group At the Drive- In, which disbanded in 2001. Lead guitarist Omar Rodríguez-López and vocalist  Cedric Bixler-Zavala then formed Mars Volta, where they had to rebuild from the ground up. This album, released in 2003, is their first studio album. It is the only album to feature founding member Jeremy Ward, as he died at twenty seven of a heroin overdose only one month before the albums release. It was this loss which prompted Lopez and Zavala to quit opiate use. Deloused also features Flea of the Red Hot Chili Peppers on bass. The album follows the story of fictional Cerpin Taxt, a man who enters a week-long coma after overdosing on a mixture of morphine and rat poison. The story is based on the real life tale of the band’s friend Julio Venegas, who went into a coma after years of drug abuse, woke up, and committed suicide by jumping off a bridge into rushhour traffic. Overall the album was really interesting. I was working with it in the background, so my attention was entirely devoted to it, but there were still quite a few moments which stuck out to me. In particular, the use of acoustic instruments with electronic and synthesized sounds gave the entire thing a very feverish sort of sound. There was certainly a lot of energy in this album, and in my mind, it was a very fair representation of the program they were trying to convey. I want to relisten to this album again with more devoted attention.",
"Lana posted a video of herself playing this with Chris Spinelli, so I decided to give it a listen. Taktak (because fuck trying to spell that last name) was a Georgian composer of the Soviet Period. He won the Stalin Prize for his First Symphony, and he also composed the Georgian USSR Anthem (a feat accomplished through a competition he applied to at age nineteen, forgot about, and then realized his winning upon hearing the piece outside of a concert hall). His influences include Mozart, Johanne Sebastian Bach and Beethoven, Alexander Scriabin, Sergei Prokofiev, and Dmitri Shostakovich. Taktak studied with Dmitri during his senior year at Tbilisi Conservatory, which led to a long standing friendship. This piece was compose in 1963, and is his most well known work. Little in known about it other than that it is based on Caucasus music, a broad categorization of the musics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Chechnya, and Georgia. Although his harmonic language tends to be simple (he denounced serial techniques as an ideological battle), this influence puts him in line with Aziz Zadeh and Tigran Hamasyan. Keystones of this folk style include repeating diatonic melodies with small tessituras, repetition of rhythms that strongly demonstrate the meter, and dance-oriented rhythms in a compound meter. Super cool piece and wonderful performance by Lana and Chris. This movement is notated in 6/8, but I felt it in a pretty solid 3/4. This might be worth investigating.",
"I found this through a sooky playlist that Meghan Ihen and Alan Thiesan made for Halloween tomorrow. Radiohead is an English band formed in England in 1985 (initially called On a Friday) They became a worldwide hit after the release of Creep in 1992, and they experienced enduring popularity through the 90’s and 2000’s. This album is their latest, released in 2016, and the lyrics address themes such as climate change, groupthink, and heartbreak. It released to significant commercial success despite its difference from their earlier style. The album incorporates elements of incorporates elements of art rock, folk, chamber music, and ambient music. I really liked this album overall. It reminded me of a cool mix between Moonchild and Ok Go. My guess is this is largely a result of the A) Mix of synthesized and acoustic instruments and B) The laid back sort of feel. I will definitely be listening to this album again, particularly the songs Burn the Witch, Glass Eyes, and True Love Waits.",
"I remember listening to Ligeti’s Musica ricercata during fall of 2018, but lord knows how much of a mess my listening logs were back then. That said, Ligeti was a Hungarian- Austrian composer of contemporary classical music during the 20th century. He is often described as the most important avant garde composer of the century, despite his style being relatively restrained (largely due to Soviet pressures) before his move to the West (Austria) in 1956. He spent quite a bit of time experimenting with electronic music in Cologne, Germany before his famous micropolyphony breakthrough with his piece Atmospheres. Micropolyphony is a process in which many lines of dense canons moving at different tempos or rhythms create vertical tone clusters. He is perhaps best known for the use of his music in many of Stanley Kubrick’s most famous films, notable 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, and Eyes Wide Shut. The usage in 2001 was a copywrite infringement, but Ligeti settled out of court and Kubrick agreed to request permission for future films. Ligeti ended up escorting Kubrick’s wife to the premiere of Eyes Wide Shut, as Kubrick had died only a few months beforehand. I should also mention that he wrote that interesting metronome piece Poème symphonique after his short stint with the Fluxus movement (prioritization of the artistic process over the final product). I also listened to the work of his son Lukas earlier this semester, Thinking Songs. This piece was written in 1965 for orchestra and choir. It sets four sections of the traditional requiem mass: Introit, Kyrie, Dies Irae, and Lacrimosa. This work calls back to the earlier Renaissance period and the polyphonic writing of that time, particularly the works of Ockeghem. He spent nine month working on the Kyrie, which featured the most complex micropolyphony he ever wrote. This is the section which came to represent the monolith in 2001. Although the work lasts only thirty minutes, it was his longest composition at the time. I have to say, i think the Kyrie is the first piece of music to ever truly unsettle me. There were a few moments where I was legitimately sacred by what I was hearing. The horrifying wash of voices in dense clusters sounded like the howling of the wind, and in my head, a very distinct image of mounds of human bones stacked for miles across a grey and desolate wasteland was formed. During the build to the end, I could nearly see the creature I imagined in my story The Darkness of the Woods weaving past the mounds towards me in a frenzied attack. Absolutely horrifying the way the piece built. Ligeti was absolutely right about his description of the sound. It isn’t like the traditional simultaneity in a dissonant sense, but rather each instance is composed of an intricate and dense web of polyphony which remains largely unheard at the surface level. The Dies Irae was also unsettling, but not in nearly the same way as the Kyrie. Something about the build of it all was really unsettling. Absolutely incredible technique. I’m wondering if there is a way to accomplish it without a massive number of performers. Something I will certainly be thinking about. I also saw that Ligeti wrote a piece for solo organ (Volumina), so I am very excited to give that a listen. I definitely need to explore his music more after hearing this piece.",
"Professor Sampson said this was her favorite Ligeti piece despite the fact that it is only like thirty seconds long, and  can totally see why. It’s just this cute little melodious fanfare for a brass instrument, and it just has a really light hearted sound. One would not be able to guess that it was written by the same Ligeti who wrote the Requiem, and I find that to be very fascinating. I kinda want to try learning it on Trombone. I might also add, I found a video of a farmer playing it on top of his stack of round bales. We live in a wild time.",
"Sam presented on this album in Comp Forum, so I decided to give it a listen. I couldn’t find a lot of info about Guilhem online other than that he is a well- known hurdy gurdy player (a stringed instrument which produces sound via a rotating wooden disk against metal strings with simple keys). I also read that he comes from a French musical family, and a lot of doors opened up for him when he built himself a custom electric hurdy gurdy in 2009. This album, released in 2018, is his first, and it features music made entirely with a hurdy gurdy. I imagine some post processing was done to achieve certain effects, such as the lower bass notes, but I do not doubt that it is entirely on one instrument. Sam’s analysis places the piece as a description of a mythical castle slowly becoming overrun with nature and lost to time. This whole album gives me a very Scottish sort of vibe, although I must admit that I am not entirely sure that this is a fair assessment. I am not familiar with that musical culture at all, and aside from the Scotch Snap, I couldn’t say exactly why it sounds that way. I’m guessing it is partially timbre (which sounds weirdly similar to bagpipes) and partially melodic. It sounds very similar to John Powell’s scores from the How to Train Your Dragon Series. In any case, I am curious to dig into the sound a bit more and learn about its history/ why it sounds the way it does. I don’t think it is something I would integrate in my own music, especially since I’m not a part of the culture, but it might expand my ears a bit. Overall a super cool album. It is good to have on in the background while working.",
"I saw a documentary about the talking heads on YouTube, and they mentioned this album. I’ve always liked the band, and since one of my favorite songs by them (Heaven) is off this album, I decided to check it out. They formed in 1975 out of New York City after moving into a loft together. They were all alumni of the Rhode Island School of Design, and Frantz new Byrne from a failed group known as the Artistics. Frantz and Byrne then formed the Talking Heads, and Frantz convinced Weymouth (his wife) to learn the bass. Their name comes from a remark made by one of their friends about the shoulder- up shot of people on television- all content, no action. Their first gig with that name was when they opened for the Ramones. In the documentary, Byrne talked about how they wanted their sound to not be defined by existing styles. He wanted a clean cut group which represented the commercialism and suburbanism of the times- a working man’s music. As such, they became one of the most pioneering and successful groups of the late 70’s and 80’s. This album is their third, and it was released in 1979. The whole thing was recorded in their NYC loft, where most of the songs arose from prolonged improvisation and subsequent refinement. The album was well received. I might also mention, in regards to the documentary, I find it fascinating that David’s process for lyric writing is very similar to the way that Professor Sampson is having me set my text right now. Awesome album.",
"Avery presented on this album in compositio forum, and given its fascinating story and cross- cultural parallels, I couldn’t resist listening to the whole thing. Fela was a Nigerian musician, composer, and human rights activist. He went to college to study medicine like his brothers, but ended up studying trumpet instead. He spent some time in America in the late 60’s where he became enthralled with the Black Power Movement. It was under the ideologies of this movement that he wrote much of his music, including this album. It was released in 1976 as a protest against mindless Nigerian soldiers fighting for an oppressive government. The album was a hit, but the Nigerian government was not happy about it. They ended up sending a thousand soldiers to his home commune where they beat many of the people nearby, burned his music equipment and masters, and killed his mother by throwing her from a window. His response was to send his mother’s coffin to the commanding officers home and write two songs about the incident, Coffin for the Head of State and Unknown Soldier (both in reference to the official inquiry that claimed the commune had been destroyed by an unknown soldier). A year later he took on twenty seven wives in order to protect them from the same abuse, and he was banned from the country of Ghana when a riot broke out during a performance of Zombie. A similar riot broke out at the Berlin Jazz Festival. Fela later went on to run for the Nigerian Presidency, and although he lost, he remained politically active until his death in 1997. It is also worth mentioning that he is responsible for developing the Afrobeat style- a music genre which involves the combination of elements of West African musical styles such as fuji music (a Nigerian musical genre) and highlife with American funk and jazz influences, with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion. The original LP had only two tracks. Overall a cool album.",
"I have been on a huge Genesis kick lately, and I realize that there are quite a few albums that I have neglected listening to. This is an attempt to fill in those gaps. This album was released in 1972 after Nursery Cryme and before Selling England. It features their longest track, Supper’s Ready, and many consider it to be a near perfect album. Watcher of the Skies sounded a lot like Battle of Epping Forest. Time Table was a really beautiful little existential piece. Get ‘Em Out by Friday was interesting tune where Gabriel takes on different vocal/ musical styles to represent different characters. I even noticed that the panning of certain characters was such to reflect a back and forth dialogue. This is certainly stuff I could borrow in the piece I’m currently working on. Can Utility and the Coastliner was pretty decent, but it didn’t leave a huge impression on me. I could draw a parallel to Ripples, One for the Vine, or really any of the work in its extended instrumental interludes. I tend to like them quite a bit, especially when they build into a climax like in Ripples. Horizons is a cool little instrumental tune drawing very clear inspiration from Bach’s G Major cello suite. The epic Supper’s Ready is a seven section work with loose ties to Christian tales (the number seven, referenced multiple times, representing perfection). I think trying to derive meaning from it is tricky, since Gabriel stated himself that it is simply a personal journey through scenes of Revelations. That being said, the imagery is still vivid enough that the piece is enjoyable without a totally cohesive plot. I feel the same way about The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, even though that piece does have a clear progression. The sixth section discusses the apocalypse, and I found it interesting that lyrics from the first section regarding the supposed wife make their way back here. Gabriel had been married the year prior, and although their marriage didn’t fail after an affair which crippled Gabriel until more than a decade later, I wouldn’t be surprised if there was some type of influence. People seem to mention it as a possibility, at least. I think the ending of this piece was really really powerful and amazing, a lot like Afterglow. Overall an amazing album. Definitely want to listen to it again soon.",
"I have a few pieces backlogged from Composition Forum to listen to, so I am going to knock them out now. I should start bringing my laptop to forum and do my logs while people present. It might engage me with the presentations more. So I’ve listened to two piece by Berio since I’ve been in college, but I haven’t really done much of a biography on him yet. He was an Italian Composer known best for his work in Experimentalism and Electronic music. He initially attempted to pursue piano, but he was unable since he injured his hand while learning how to use a gun during WWII. This led him to focus on composition instead. He studied a bit in California before moving to Germany, where he met Pierre Boulez, Karlheinz Stockhausen, György Ligeti and Mauricio Kagel (a German Composer). They founded Studio di fonologia musicale in Milan (an electronic music studio in Italy, much much like the Swedish Elektronmusikstudion in Sweden). He invited many composers to work there, including John Cage. in 1962 he returned to California under a teaching post at Mill’s College thanks to Darius Millhaud. He then taught for a while at Juilliard, where he founded the Juilliard Ensemble (a group dedicated to the performance of Contemporary music). His students included Steve Reich, Louis Andriessen, and Phil Lesh of the Grateful Dead. This piece was composed in 1968, shortly after the assasination of Martin Luther King Jr. It exists in two versions- one for mixed ensemble and one for eight voices with orchestra (I am listening to the mixed ensemble). It seems as though the piece is fragmenting his name into its component syllables, only stating it in full at the very end of the piece. The piece is wandering in almost every regard, giving it an almost unsettling sound. I have to wonder why he chose to write the piece in such a manner. Obviously the piece is made out of reverence for a great man, but I am curious if he had any reason for approaching the work in this matter outside of stylistic preference. I will have to ask Professor Sampson if she has heard any interpretations. Overall I enjoyed the piece quite a bit. I really should listen to more stuff by Berio. I guess it is difficult for me because I want to document info about everything I listen to, which is so time consuming. At this point, I might consider going lighter on works by composers who I have written about before, saving lengthy ramblings for people who I have never heard of. I will still document, but it might look more like my Fall 2018 listening logs. What a mess those were! I will do better this time around.",
"This presentation was done by Colin, but I don’t remember why I wanted to hear more of this work in specific. Teng, born Cynthia Yih Shih, is an American pianist and composer of Taiwanese descent. She is based in Detroit, Michigan and has released five studio albums. She earned a degree from Stanford University in Computer Science, and she worked with Cisco Systems for a while before quitting to pursue music. She also spent time composing in Stanford’s Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), a facility once again similar to Sweden’s EMS and Italy’s Studio di fonologia musicale (look at that, all three in one day). This piece is from her fifth studio album Aims, released in September of 2013 (I will listen to the whole thing sometime soon). It was composed while she was in graduate school in Michigan (pursuing a degree in sustainable enterprise), where she relied heavily on the school’s sound library of things like African percussion and orchestral instruments. This piece comes from the perspective of a sentient Acxiom database. Acxiom is an organization that collects on and off line data about people and sells it to third party retailers. She was shocked by just how much information it had about her (this info is publicly available), and such surprise became the basis of the piece. She said the piece was an attempt to reconcile two opposing viewpoints on the matter by combining Orwellian lyrics with gentle, nearly ecclesiatical harmonies. Overall a really cool piece. There were a couple moments that landed pretty well with me, particularly the line Now we possess you. I’m not sure how I feel about the matter, but I think that the perspective of the piece is incredibly unique and interesting nonetheless. I love how it ends with Amen. So many meanings can be taken from that. I can’t wait to listen to the rest of the album. I will come back and write a bit about it once I do.",
"I cannot for the life of me remember who presented on this, but I do remember liking the piece quite a bit. Courtney Bryan is a black female composer from New Orleans. She studied at Oberlin, Rutgers, and Columbia University. She is known for combining elements of jazz with gospel traditions. She is currently on the faculty at Tulane University in New Orleans, and she is also the composer in residence for the Jacksonville Symphony. This piece was premiered and commissioned by the American Composers Orchestra at Jazz at Lincoln Center. It is for orchestra and recorded sounds, and it, as she says, ... explores the sound of improvisation in Holiness-preaching traditions. I draw inspiration from recorded sermons, The Praying Slave Lady by Pastor Shirley Caesar, The Eagle Stirs His Nest by Reverend C. L. Franklin, and Reverend Charles Albert Tindley’s hymn, Stand By Me. Included are the voices of Marlene Pinnock and of activists in Ferguson, Missouri from 2014. The piece is her response to Police Brutality and Systematic Racism. The thing that sticks out to me most about the work is how well the electronic elements work with orchestra. I have heard such fixed media methods in smaller ensembles, but I think it is super effective in this context. The music doesn’t follow the recorded media exactly, but rather the sounds dip in and out of the orchestra. This is something I might consider exploring sometime in the near future, as the effect was really cool. Overall I enjoyed this piece quite a bit. I will definitely be looking into more of Courtney Bryan’s stuff!",
"Aaron presented on one of the pieces from this album in comp forum today, so I’ve decided to give the whole thing a listen. Benjamin is a black and English poet, artist, musician, and vocalist. He grew up in London, but after a failing high school and having a falling out with his parents, he moved to Paris. He lived on the streets there for a few years while busking to make ends meet before making his debut with the EP Cornerstone. He gained most of his musical skill by absorbing the styles of Debussy and Satie, and to this day he still cannot read music. Cornerstone  put him on the map, and Paul McCartney encouraged him to continue his musical career. It is worth mentioning that the lyrics to a lot of his songs are improvisations on loose themes. This album was his first studio album, and it was released in 2015 (Clementine is not that old- 31 on Saturday). The album was a huge hit, and it won him the 2015 Mercury Prize (an award for the best album released in the UK by a British or Irish act). The New York Times dubbed him on of the most culturally influential people of 2016 because of the album. I really enjoyed this whole album. It was easy listening, but in the best kind of way. Definitely going to listen to this again.",
"Ross recommended me this piece. I auditioned for Frednonia with his Toccata and I’ve obviously heard Sabre Dance, but beyond that I am not familiar with his work. He was a Soviet and Armenian Composer. He was a graduate of the Moscow Conservatory, and along with Prokofiev and Shostakovich, his music was denounced by the Soviet Union. He is considered to be a national treasure in Armenia, and he extensively used folk tunes from that region. He was also a strong supporter of the Soviet Union (the October Revolution greatly impacted him), and he apologized profusely after his denunciation. Apparently the Adagio from his opera Gayaneh (the same opera as Sabre Dance) found its way into Kubricks 2001. This piece, composed in 1944, commemorates the 25th anniversary of the Russian Revolution. He claims it is, a requiem of wrath, a requiem of protest against war and violence. Nicknamed the bell, the critics said The Bell is 50 minutes of unrelenting power, and those moments when you think it’s relenting are simply chances for Khachaturian to reload the IS-3 tank that is his orchestra. I kinda hate that, despite how comical it is, but maybe the piece will be good in spite of it. I’m only about two minutes in currently, but already this piece is sooooooo Russian. I have found, in general, that I tend to enjoy Russian music, so this isn’t necessarily a bad thing. I guess I just have a bad taste in my mouth since he was such a strong supporter of the Soviet Union. To each their own, I guess. The piece still speaks for itself. I’ve only been half paying attention to this piece, but the Dies Irae just popped through. This work was a solid aight. Honestly just made me feel mostly overwhelmed.",
"I’ve decided, in light of my recent and fierce announce with popular solo piano canon, that I am only going to play music by female composers next semester. I discussed it with Father Sean, and he recommended my three composers to look into: Lili (yay), Ellen Taaffe Zwillich, and Fanny Mendelssohn. I’m starting my exploration with Lili since I am familiar with her orchestral works, and her canon is small. This was the first piece I found, composed in 1912. This short piece would certainly be a challenge. I think the biggest difficulties would be balancing the chords, which are often four notes per hand with a melody imbedded within. That said, it is a truly beautiful piece of music which is more reminiscent of Debussy than some of her other works. Definitely one to consider.",
"This next work, composed in 1914 (I think), is in three movements. I could not find a lot of information on this piece at all, other than the movement titles: Dun Vieux Jardin (Of an Old Garden), Dun Jardin Clair (Of a Clear/Bright Garden), and Cortege. The first movement is about the same length as her Prelude (three minutes). It didn’t affect me quite as much as the former, but it was still a cool piece of music. I think that the same challenges would apply. The second movement was very reminiscent to the first, but I liked it a bit better. The third movement though! What a cool little piece of music it is! It reminds me a bit of the Passepied from Debussy’s Suite Bergamasque, but much more light on its feet. If I had to choose between all the pieces I heard by her, It would probably be a draw between her Prelude and this last movement.",
"So Cam showed me a piece from this album last night, and I had a quasi- religious experience while listening to it. We have very similar tastes in music, and listening to such a cool piece for the first time with someone who was vibing with the same energy was pretty wild. So I have been aching to listen to the rest of this album. Frost is a supergroup, meaning that each member has a successful solo career outside of the group (sort of like that project Mick Jagger worked on, Superheavy). They were formed in 2004 by Jem Godfrey and members of Arena, Kino, and IQ. This album is their first, released in 2006. Although they have had multiple hiatuses since its release, they have three records to date and another two currently in the works. It is worth mentioning that this group has had (and will most likely continue to have) a lot of staff turnovers, especially given the nature of supergroups. Also, the asterisk next to their name is supposedly a serving suggestion indicating serve chilled. Frost also has a few close associations with Dream Theatre, an American Progressive rock group formed out of Berklee. I have heard of them, but they might be worth further investigation. This album is also based on the book The Apprentice by Gordon Houghton, in which, A corpse is resurrected and apprenticed to the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse for seven days. During the course of the week, he tries to remember how he died, accompanies Death on his daily round, and learns what it means to be undead. (Google Books) That might also be worth checking out. The tune Black Light Machine is just so good. Milliontown is also an absolutely incredible tune. It is very reminiscent of Suppers Ready in its long form, sectional nature. This whole album is a new favorite. It is like Genesis on steroids. Absolutely cannot wait to check out the rest of their shit.",
"This is their second album, released in 2008. The eponymous first tune is interesting in its usage of binaural audio, which accounts for Head Transfer Functions to create the incredibly realistic illusion of depth. The tunes Dear Dead Days and Falling Down were also of particular interest to me. I enjoyed them quite a bit. In a general sense, I found this album to be a bit sharper than Milliontown. I enjoyed it quite a bit, but I definitely prefer the former. Super cool stuff, in any case. The last tune Wonderland was also really cool. It was somewhat similar to Milliontown in its longer form, but it had a totally different feel. There were sections in the middle that reminded me a bit of Peter Gabriel, specifically the use of talking drums, and I swear there is a half quote of the Swan Chorale from Sibelius Five. I think this is one of my favorite tunes on the album. Another note: I love their use of sound effects in this album, and I know in a couple tunes from the next album (which I will listen to fully tomorrow), they integrate them into the groove of the piece. Such a cool technique that I might use someday, if I ever take a crack at music more along these lines.",
"I’ve been meaning to check out this work for quite a while, so I am glad to finally get around to it. Apparently this is also the first piece of Stravinsky’s I have listened to since college, but since I don’t have time for a short bio right now, I will come back in a bit and add it. This opera, however, was written in 1957 at the tail end of his career. Its period of composition spanned half a decade, and as such, it represents the convergence of his switch from diatonic to twelve- tone techniques. There is no plot, but the work is sectional and scored for twelve dancers. It was choreographed by  George Balanchine and premiered buy Robert Craft. Watching a production, I can see how Watkin’s may have viewed this as a recalling of his entire career. The combination of the two distinct styles is very unique, and I can definitely hear elements of some of his earlier ballets with the Ballet Russes. Also, one of the movements quotes the lick like fifty times. I also really like the addition of dancers to the music. I almost just listened without watching, but it totally adds another layer of interest. It makes me sort of interested in trying the choreography collaboration next semester. This piece is very cool, and since I also enjoyed seeing choreography along with the Little Mermaid Ballade, it might be cool to try again on a more professional scale. Overall, I enjoyed this work. I will have to try listening without the choreography next time to see if my perceptions are changed as a result. Hi, Matt from the future here (September 2021- my god, two years later and post Covid). This piece is so wild. I revisited cause I’m working with hexachordal combinatoriality, and Coleman said this opera uses it a ton. The impressions of the system are really cool. It’s equal parts functional, but also slightly foreign to the ears. In that sense it is very very reminiscent of Ballet Russes stuff like Petrushka. It has a pretty clear sense of direction, but it’s getting there with beer goggles and a peg leg.",
"Derek suggested I check out this album. I listened to DAMN earlier this semester and enjoyed it, and he said that this album is way better. This is probably because, along with a bunch of other Black cultural influences, this album is cited as being heavily influenced by jazz. This album is Kendrick’s third, released in 2015 just before DAMN. It is another example of Conscious Rap, as its socially and politically charged lyrics earned it critical acclaim among black and white audiences alike. I really enjoyed this album. There were a lot of tunes on it that I vibed really hard with, especially Alright. I can definitely hear the jazz influence. This album felt like it had, musically, a bit less edge than DAMN. I paid more mind to the lyrics while listening than I normally do, and some of them were really poignant and affecting. The song u was especially powerful, and it brought a few tears to my eyes. Musically the album is a tad softer, but lyrically it is raw and emotional. I think this juxtaposition is incredibly effective. I liked this album a lot, I’ll definitely listen to it again. The last tracks final lyrics are nuts. Totally beautiful. The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it. Its only job is to eat or consume everything around it in order to protect itself from this mad city. While consuming its environment the caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive. One thing it noticed is how much the world shuns him, but praises the butterfly. The butterfly represents the talent, the thoughtfulness and the beauty within the caterpillar. But having a harsh outlook on life, the caterpillar sees the butterfly as weak, and figures out a way to pimp it to his own benefits. Already surrounded by this mad city, the caterpillar goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him. He can no longer see past his own thoughts. Hes trapped. When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take root, such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city. The result? Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant. Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle. Although the butterfly and caterpillar are completely different, they are one and the same",
"Another Mars Volta album, this one recommended by Cam. This album is their third, released in 2006 following Frances the Mute. It is their first album without a single, unifying narrative. Rather, each track draws inspiration from various, random sources of interest. I think what sticks out to me most about Mars Volta in general is how they use very specific and unique effects to elicit certain moods. I’m not trying to say that their music doesn’t groove, but it often sounds to me more like a contemporary text setting than a piece which was written with a groove in mind. I think this whole concept is really fascinating. I will say, however, that this makes passive listening pretty ineffective. Obviously passive listening isn’t always the ideal option, but I find it to be especially true in this case. There are too many ‘moments’ being missed if one is not paying attention to the album. This is why I will probably relisten to these albums over break, because I want to make sure I am fully absorbing/ understanding the artistic vision for these works. Anything else would be a disservice to the artist. I will say that a lot of this album was in Spanish, so I only could pick out a few things here and there lyrically. I really enjoyed the tune Viscera Eyes. I also really liked the tune Day of the Baphomets, specifically the bari sax lines. Overall a pretty while album that I want to give a closer listen sometime soon.",
"This is their third and most recent studio album, released in 2016. Jem Godfrey explained that it was his midlife crisis album, as his father had passed away just four months before recording. It is supposed to be about the ephemeral nature of life, and how tomorrow starts today. I think this is my favorite album that they have done. It is just a cool listen the whole way through.",
"Ok so this is prettttty cool. Professor Sampson was commissioned by the Kurt Rohde Emerging Composer Fund. The premiere was done by the Left Coast Chamber Ensemble. Admittedly I had trouble understanding the text, as I normally do with lyrics, but this piece is still super effective. I love the inclusion of guitar with string quartet, as the unexpected and tasteful use of its timbre adds another layer of interest which might not have been found with just string quartet. The piece had a lot of really amazing moments, and overall it was a joy to listen to. I am so fortunate to be studying under such incredible faculty, and it has inspired me greatly in terms of my own composition. I was beginning to feel a little down on myself regarding the text setting I am currently working on, but I suddenly feel as though it is all going to be alright. I have faith in my compositional instincts, and with the amazing guidance of Professor Sampson and all the other composition faculty here at Fredonia, I know things will turn out just fine.",
"So this is probably one of the last things I would willingly listen to, but I have a few friends that really dig his stuff, so I figure I might as well check him out. He is a singer, songwriter, and actor. He made his musical debut on the X- Factor in 2010, where after being eliminated early on, he formed the group One Direction and went on to place third in the competition. One Direction was a massive group in the early 2010’s, producing four studio albums and going on four world tours. This was all going down right around my middle school years, and there is a lot of research to suggest that musical tastes of that period influence the musical tastes for the rest of one’s life. This might explain why a lot of people my age tend to love One Direction (whereas I still prefer Chicago and Genesis). I imagine this is also why he is still winning awards like Sexiest Male in Pop or 50 Fittest Boys. It is also worth mentioning that he had a role in the film Dunkirk. One Direction went on an indefinite hiatus in 2016 (the disaster of the decade for many), and Harry picked up a solo career. This album, released just a few days ago, is his second. According to Styles, the album is about Having sex and feeling sad. He also supposedly used psychedelic drugs during production. I honestly didn’t mind this album too much, but I also wasn’t a huge fan. It sounds like pretty derivative pop a lot of the time; however, there were moments where he added an element that was unique/ interesting. One example which stuck out to me was the sweeping EQ of the vocals in Lights Up, which sounded a lot like something The Mars Volta, Frost, Genesis, or some other Prog Rock Band would do. I also heard a lot of folk influences, including straight forward vocal melodies with acoustic accompaniment. Taken as a whole, the album is much more diverse in nature than I thought it was going to be. I definitely had an idea in my head about how it was going to sound, given my experience with One Direction and his single Sign of the Times, yet I was pleasantly surprised to find an album that I might actually consider listening to again. To my ears, the album sounds like an amalgamation of Pop, Folk, and a touch of Prog Rock. Pretty interesting.",
"Colin suggested I check out this album a few days ago. They are a British trio from Norwich, consisting of Sax, Keys, and Drums. They are known for combining elements of ambient, jazz, electronic music, and world music. This album, released in 2017, is their third album. Aside from this, there really isn’t a lot of information on them. My guess is that they make the majority of their income from touring, while the albums which spawn from such sessions supplements their careers. I liked this album a lot. It was pretty laid back and nice to listen to. Definitely would be good for putting on in the background of a formal occasion.",
"I’ve definitely listened to this album before in my childhood, but I don’t remember anything about it. All I know is that this band’s name has popped up a lot since my dive into progressive rock, so here I am. This group, an English Prog Rock Band, was formed in 1987 by Steven Wilson as a solo project. He soon brought on collaborators, and they became the first permanent lineup. Their sound has shifted over the years, starting with Psychedelic Rock reminiscent to that of Pink Floyd, and ending with Prog Metal in the early 2000’s. The group drifted apart as its members began working on solo projects, and they ruled out a reformation in 2018. Despite their massive influence on other musicians and a cult following, they stayed largely outside of the mainstream. This led them to be dubbed the most important band you’d never heard of. This album, released in 2002, is their seventh studio album. This album represents their departure from the pop rock sound into more prog metal territory. The album is not strictly a concept album, but all of the tunes relate loosely to serial killers, youthful innocence gone wrong, and criticisms of the modern world. The title is Latin for In Absence. The album was the band’s biggest commercial success at the time, and it also one the 2004 Surround Sound Music Award for best 5.1 mix (AKA, I need to listen to this through my 5.1). This album is so cool so far. It is chaulk full of the macabre and the beautiful. The tunes Lips of Ashes and Gravity Eyelids (depicting Necrophilia and Rape, respectviely) were absolutely fascniating and unsettling tunes. The tune Sound of Muzak was also a really interesting criticism of the music industry, and Prodigal was an interesting character study in reference to the biblical story of the Prodigal Son. .3 is a fascinating criticism of what appears to be the nuclear arms. It is also worth pointing out that 0.3 represented rationally is 3/10, or 10:3. Peter 10:3 from the Bible is about the apocalypse raining down from the skies. I think that is such a cool little detail. The Creator has a Mastertape is about a man that tortures and rapes his family whilst recording the act for future enjoyment. You really can’t get a whole lot darker than that, and I think that musically depicting such a circumstance is quite the undertaking. I personally do not think I would be able to do it. This tune, like a lot of the previous tunes, also features a bit of religious symbolism (Has a Mastertape vs. Has a Master Plan). This idea of the most heinous of things being construed and connected the most holy is fascinating. I’m sure Neitszche would have found it interesting. Heartattack in a Layby is about a man expressing regret over his life as he dies alone in a roadside stOpus  Strip the Soul is essentially about a man torturing and killing his family. Maybe the same guy from The Creator has a Mastertape? The last tune, Collapse the Light into Earth is about a man trying to stay strong in the face of a personal loss. I have to guess, given the nature of who we are talking about, that this is an internal mental process after killing someone. For me, the line Collapse the Light into the Earth refers to putting a body in the ground. Haunting, especially with the sheer beauty of the piece juxtaposed with the meaning it contains. I asked Cam Seib if he has heard the album, and he said it is about the English serial killer Fred West. This would seem to make sense, given the nature of his crimes. Totally crazy.",
"More Tailleferre. This popped up in my YouTube recommendations, so here I am. I cannot find any information on this piece, other than that it was written in 1917 and revised in 1978. The first movement was absolutely beautiful, and it had a pretty ridiculous amount of energy. It seems this was accomplished by fragments of the melody sequencing upwards over a harmonic structure which was shifting tonal centers in a predictable way. The second movement was an exciting and memorable little tune. It was definitely more conservative in style than the first movement, especially in terms of its form (I think it was Ternary). The third movement was gorgeous as well. Tailleferre definitely has a way with motifs, both in terms of how she builds them into her melodies and how she develops them throughout. Much like her string quartet, I absolutely love the way she handles her material. The interest level is very high throughout to me, and I am always surprised by the things she manages to do. Also, she ended this movement on a B7(#9), so I cannot complain. I absolutely loveeee the last movement. It was so interesting and exciting the whole way through. Incredible piece of music, probably a new favorite!",
"Time for some Messiaen. I literally have no idea how this piece made its way into my YouTube watch later, but here I am. I have heard of Messiaen before, but I have never actually listened to any of his music. He was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist of the 20th century. His music is know for its harmonic and melodic complexity, and he is also known for his modes of limited transposition. They are musical modes or scales that fulfill specific criteria relating to their symmetry and the repetition of their interval groups, and he compiled them in his book La technique de mon langage musical. He had synesthesia, and color was a very important part of his compositional process. He also transcribed many birdsongs, which became frequent components of his compositions. He also did a lot of travelling, and many world elements became integrated into his music (particularly, Indonesian gamelans). He was also known for his use of symmetry and palindromes in many aspects of his music. He entered the Paris Conservatory at age eleven, where he studied with Paul Dukas, Charles Widor, and Marcel Dupre. He was given a post at a church nearby, and married his first wife. She tragically lost her memory after a bad operation, and she spent the rest of her life in mental institutions. At the outbreak of WWII, Messaien was drafted as a medical auxiliary (due largely to his poor eyesight). He was captured and taken as a POW in 1940, at which point he composed his famous Quartet for the End of Time (a piece which I really should listen to again). After being released a year later, he was given a post as composition professor at the Paris Conservatory, where he stayed until retirement. It was during this time that he wrote his book, taught students, and transcribed birdsongs. His students included Iannis Xenakis, Pierre Boulez, and Karlheinz Stockhausen (again, more composers that I need to dig into at some point soon). He died in 1992. This work, a commission from the New York Philharmonic, is his last completed work. The work is an orchestral epic in eleven movements which translates to Lightning Over the Beyond. Thus, the piece is centered largely around representations of Roman Catholic ideologies, another common theme in a lot of his music. This movement, the last, translates as The Christ, Light of Paradise. I would listen to the whole thing, but since I don’t have quite enough time after writing this whole thing, I will have to return later to listen to the whole thing. Maybe this movement will have new context once I do. I must admit that the piece was not what I expected it to be, but I liked it all the same. The scoring calls for a large orchestra, but this movement featured only strings and I believe a few upper woodwinds. The harmony was definitely non- tonal, but there was a discernible rise and fall of tension throughout. This gave the whole piece a very glassy sort of sound which I quite enjoyed. I definitely want to experience this piece in the context of the whole work. Maybe when I return from lunch. I did more digging on Modes of Limited Transposition as I listened to this piece all the way through. It is a really interesting yet simple concept. In order to be a mode of limited transposition, two criteria must be met: the number of unique transpositions and modes must be less than the number of notes in the scale. For example, since the major scale has twelve unique transpositions and seven unique modes, it is not a mode of limited transposition. The whole tone scale on the other hand (Messaien’s first mode), only has two unique transpositions and one unique mode. His list contains seven modes. The first two are the whole tone and octatonic scales, respectively, and they become increasingly more chromatic as the list goes on. Messaien claims that, while there are other limited modes of transposition, they will always be truncations of the original seven (that is, one of the original modes with some notes removed). Super interesting concept which cusps into the realm of mathematics, as does much of music. Now that I am thinking about it, it might be kinda cool to experiment with these in my flute solo. I have already thought about using the whole tone scale, so why not extend that. Complexity within a well defined and predictable system. The piece as a whole was really cool. Definitely something I would listen to again.",
"Since I enjoyed In Absentia so much, I asked Jimmy if he had any more Porcupine Tree recommendations. This album, released a year after In Absentia, was released in 2005. It is their eighth studio album, and it was initially planned to be a companion album to an original film which failed to find funding. As such, each track contributes to what Wilson described as a surreal ghost story. It is worth mentioning that this album was mastered at a lower volume level in order to preserve more of the dynamic range. This is certainly noticeable. Especially since I began listening directly after some other music. Lazarus is a really beautiful/ comforting tune, but yet again, it is a juxtaposition against a darker subject (in this case, a man’s dead parents calling for him to join them). Halo was an interesting criticism of organized religion. Arriving Somewhere but Not Here is about someone reflecting on their life after death. The vocals have a limited bandwidth, making them sound like they are coming through a phone. I’ve heard this effect before, but I am just now realizing that, at least in this context, it might be being used to show that the narration is coming from somewhere distant. Open Car describes a toxic relationship the main character is involved with (she just wants sex, but he loves her). This is an excellent example of going against the prosody of the text to show tension. Overall it was a pretty cool album, although it didn’t affect me quite as much as In Absentia. That said, I would definitely listen to this album again.",
"This recommendation comes from Mike, amazingly. I told him I was listening to more Prog Rock these days, and he recommended this group. This album seemed cool, so I picked it on a whim. The group was formed in 1970 out of Augusta Georgia, although the lineup didn’t solidify until a few years later. The members were all music students at Miami University, and it was there that they met. At the time, Miami University had a vibrant music culture, including students such as Pat Metheny and  Jaco Pastorius. The keyboard player, Mark Parish, also studied electronic music at Columbia University in New York City with Alice Shields, a protege of Wendy Carlos. They are known for their fusion of Jazz, Rock, Country, and Classical elements. This album was released in 1980, and it received a Grammy nomination for Best Rock Instrumental Performance. Aside from this, I couldn’t find a lot of information on the album. Overall, I didn’t really like this album. Hereafter was a decent tune, but I could definitely take or leave the rest of the tracks. I found the album to be somewhat awkward in its style, as if it wasn’t sure what it wanted to be. The country elements just didn’t really meld all that well for me, and I didn’t really hear a lot of jazz or classical influences. I’m not saying it is a bad album, but it definitely isn’t my cup of tea.",
"Professor Sampson recommended this piece to the composers, so here I am. Danny Elfman is a composer who is perhaps best known for his plethora of original film scores (including The Simpsons theme). He was also the frontman of the New Wave band Oingo Boingo in the early 1980’s. That said, he also writes a fair amount of concert works. This piece, composed in 2017, is one of his latest. It was Co-commissioned by the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, Stanford Live at Stanford University, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. The work was premiered in 2017 by the Czech National Symphony. The nickname comes from the fact that the work has 1,111 bars of music. It is in four movements with a rough arch form. Critics have drawn parallels to Shostakovich, Prokofiev, and Bernstein. What an amazing piece of music. I enjoyed it the whole way through. Every movement had this dark atmosphere, yet the way it was handled in each was unique (Although the first and last were similar, hence the quasi arch form). Another point to note is just how percussive the whole work is, not only in terms of the actual percussion, but also in terms of the soloist and the rest of the orchestra. I think this was most clearly evident in the second movement, which was my favorite of them all. Also, the ending of the fourth movement was so exhilarating and beautiful that it brought tears to my eyes (an occurrence which only happens occasionally while I am listening to orchestral music). Such a well done concerto, and definitely a new favorite. I will be listening to this again very very soon.  I listened to the last movement again, and I sobbed at the ending. First time that has happened since Venus.",
"In honor of today, Alan Theisen recommended this work. I’ve heard Penderecki’s Threnody before, but I have not heard this piece. It was composed in 1980, and it makes frequent references to the carol Silent Night. It is a single movement, modified sonata form. This piece definitely had its moments, but overall I wasn’t a huge fan. I felt as though there wasn’t a lot of memorable harmonic or melodic content to grab onto, so although it did have unity as a whole, it was hard to hear at times. A think a relisten would probably help. Maybe sometime next week.",
"Mickie recommended I check out this song cycle after they looked at my song cycle prime line. In particular, they said I should watch out for the blending of conversational elements with more dramatic elements, as well as how the piano carries melodic content. I couldn’t find any information on the work, other than that it was composed in 1999 and has four movements. I am guessing that Ophelia refers to the character from Shakespeares Hamlet. The main thing I notice is how he occasionally repeats material for dramatic effect, or to creat a sense of continuity (ie. repeating text from the beginning of a piece at the end so the listener can hear it through a new lense). I don’t think that specific example applies to what I am doing, but I can certainly mess around with repeating material in movements other than Sorry That I Snapped. For example, I might consider having just the tenor recite Maybe we should have gotten those pickled eggs an octave lower after they sing it with the bass. That is a very specific, off the cuff example. I might consider reading through the text as if I was an actor, taking the emotional state of every line to its furthest extreme. In doing that, I can better see where the moods shift or stay the same. That will also inform the type of harmonies I want to use, how much space a section needs, or if text needs to be repeated. I also notice that Heggie likes to take fragments of the prime line, modify them slightly, and use them almost like a countersubject against the prime line itself. This gives the songs a clear sense of unity and connectedness, especially if I make the work quasi- cyclical and use them to construct a more overarching narrative. Specifically, I could do this at the end of the last movement, where I use the pitches from movement four to end the work. I think I should also spend more time thinking about the cell transformations, specifically sequencing, augmentation, or diminution. I think that those are relatively simple techniques that have the potential to add a lot of depth and interest to what it is doing. So, in summary, I need to spend more time living with what I have so far before moving forward. I think my goal should be to get the prime line to a point where it has a musically emotional impact without any sort of harmonic accompaniment. At that point, I think I will be ready to move on.",
"This album popped up in my Spotify recommendations for being similar to In Absentia. Since I absolutely loved that album, I decided I would give it a listen. Anekdoten is a Swedish Prog Rock group that formed in 1991. They are known for their heavy use of Mellotron (an Electrophone keyboard) and drawing on traditions of 70’ Prog Rock, specifically King Crimson. I haven’t heard of this group, so I will have to check them out. Aside from this, I couldn’t find much info about the group. From what I read on their website, they still tour pretty extensively across Europe. This album, released in 2015, is their latest. Overall I liked this album a lot. It did feel a lot like Porcupine tree at times, but the longer instrumental sections gave it a much more Prog Rock-y feel. Definitely an album I would listen to again.",
"I saw that today was Bowie’s birthday, and since I have never really listened to one of his albums cover to cover, I figured now would be a good time to do so. I looked up his discography, which turned out to be far more extensive than I was expecting. I grabbed my book, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, and that narrowed my choices a bit. I settled on this one since I am familiar with at least one of the tunes. But first, a bit about Bowie. He was born David Jones in 1947. He was an English songwriter and actor, and is considered to be one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century, particularly for his innovative work during the 70’s. This included his use of the androgynous alter ego Ziggy Stardust. This played into the Glam Rock era of the early 70’s, which was a UK movement that placed emphasis on outrageous and fantastical outfits, as well as musical influence from throw away genres. Bowie was also a close collaborator with Mott the Hoople (for whom he wrote All the Young Dudes) and Brian Eno, a record producer who worked with other groups such as the Talking Heads and Devo. He died in 2016 from liver cancer, just two days after his last album was released. I am obviously grazing over a lot of information here, but there is so much about this man that one could probably write a dissertation on his life. I tried to touch on the most important/ relevant details, as always. Fully exploring his musical career would take much more time than I have currently. This album, released in 1977, is the second of the Berlin Trilogy, three albums recorded in West Berlin with Brian Eno during the height of the Cold War. The Berlin Wall was only 500 feet away from the studio, in fact, and much of the album is a reflection of the social and political atmosphere there at the time. The album also draws a lot of influence from Kraftwerk. The eponymous track remains one of David Bowie’s most well known and influential tunes, and the album too has stood the test of time. Apparently Phillip Glass wrote a symphony based on the album called Heroes Symphony, so I will have to check that out sometime. It also turns out that the guitarist from King Crimson played on the title track. All the more reason to check out that group. Also, the tune was inspired by one of his (married) bandmates kissing a girl underneath a turret next to the wall. The romance is doomed in so many ways, but at least they had that moment. Things don’t need to last forever to have value. Sons of the Silent Age is an interesting commentary on that generation (1920’s- 40’s; too young to fight in the World Wars, but just in time to grow in a booming post war economy). Bowie draws on Neitzche’s philosophy hear, making the message that he would rather change the world by his morals than die as an average joe. Heroes is a great fucking tune, but I like this one more. It’s so simple, but sooooo good. The A Side of this album ends with Blackout, making almost the rest of the album instrumental tracks. This is the same on the other Berlin Trilogy albums, meaning that all the B sides are alternate worlds from the A Sides. Overall a really really cool album. I had only ever really heard Heroes by Bowie, so I was greatly surprised by the sound of this album. It is far more electronic than I had expected. Without having heard a ton of Kraftwerk, I can only assume that the influence is present. I will have to listen to some stuff by them. I really loved the tune Sense of Doubt. So full and powerful, and it almost sounds like it was mixed up from the rest of the album. In fact, I almost enjoyed the B side of the album more than the A side. There was some really beautiful stuff in there.",
"I’ve heard of Supertramp, I know my dad liked them, but I don’t know anything about them. This album is also in the big book, so I decided to check it out. They were an English rock and that formed in 1969. Their earlier stuff is mostly progressive rock, although the moved onto more radio friendly pop elements in the mid 70’s. They were founded by  Roger Hodgson and Rick Davies, and they are known for their use of the Wurlitzer electric piano and saxophone. Hodgson and Davies took cowriting credit for most of the tunes, but like John and Paul, they were normally written by mostly one or the other. They toured and produced studio albums until 1988, when the relationship between Hodgson and Davies splintered. They have had a few reunions since, and they even released a couple studio albums in the late 90’s and early 2000’s. This album, released in 1974, is their third. The album represents their commercial breakthrough in the US and UK, and next to Breakfast in America, it is their most popular album. The album deals loosely with themes of loneliness and mental stability, but is not a concept album. I honestly wasn’t a huge fan of this album. It was ok, but the whole thing felt a little dry to me, both in terms of lyrics, instrumentation, harmony, and melody. Maybe I’m just too used to the thicker stuff. There are definitely a couple of tunes I would listen to again, especially Bloody Well Right, but otherwise, I could take or leave most of the album.",
"So I’ve heard this band’s name tossed around a lot, and after reading their wikipedia, I can understand why. They were an English Progressive Rock group formed in 1968 by the Giles brothers. They are best known for their synthesis of a variety of musical genres, including Jazz, Classical, Experimental, Minimalist, and more. They were responsible for influencing contemporaries such as Yes and Genesis, and they cite Donovan, the Beatles, Phillip Glass, Steve Reich, Terry Reilly, Bela Bartok, and Gustav Holst as sources of influence. They often played Mars during shows, and often rehearsed with Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds. They collaborated with the Flaming Lips once, and Steve Wilson of Porcupine Tree (who remastered some of their stuff for stereo) cited them as an immense source of influence on his solo career. They have released a plethora of albums, and despite a large number of staff turnovers, they are still active today. This album, released in 1969, is their debut album. The term Crimson King refers to a ruler which experiences mass bloodshed and resistance during their term, and this album was released at the peak of worldwide resistance to American presence in Vietnam. The album was initially met with mixed reviews, but it later became a staple of progressive rock. I think that this album is like Wind and Wuthering or Trick of the Tale in the sense that the concept is a loosely defined theme. The first track, 21st Century Schizoid Man, is clearly about war and imperialism. The second track, I Talk to the Wind, is about the conflict of religious ideologies. It is a beautiful tune that reminds me thematically of Dialogues I and II by Chicago.  Epitaph is lyrically incredible. It describes fear and confusion in the midst of global conflict, with the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Vietnam War still so fresh. Knowledge is a deadly friend if no one sets the rules. Like damn, that’s good. Musically, the track tends to oscillate between these light, dry textures and more intense, thick ones. This juxtaposition is really interesting and powerful. I see it as musically reflecting the state of things. For example, the tune starts out with the narrators voice singing clearly and mostly alone as it states its concerns. When the first chorus occurs, the texture thickens and the narrator is nearly drowned out. Is that not how viewpoints are contextualized in the bigger scheme of things? This tune is fucking amazing, and so topical right now. Moonchild is an allusion to Aleister Crowley’s 1917 novel of the same name. He was an English Mystic with extremely questionable views, and his novel tells the tale of a child with magical powers so strong that she could destroy the world. Interpret that how you want. The tune is also in two parts, The Dream and The Illusion. The Dream is the two minutes of lyrical content, while The Illusion is ten minutes of free improvisation. This tune makes me really interested to check out some of their later stuff, where they take in more influences from contemporary classical music. The last tune, In the Court of the Crimson King, ties together basically everything from the album. A small piece of every track makes some sort of appearance here, either musically, lyrically, or thematically. I think the layered interpretations of this tune are also really interesting, given the meaning of Crimson King as both a monarch and a devil. This whole album is incredible on so many levels. I’m a big fan. I wonder if these guys ever listened to Black Angels.",
"I loved what I have heard of Porcupine Tree, and since Wilson’s name has popped up elsewhere since then, I decided to check out some of his solo stuff. He is an English musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer mostly in the progressive rock vein. He was the lead man of Porcupine Tree, but he has performed and worked with a plethora of other groups including Yes, Jethro Tull, and King Crimson (he helped remaster the 40th anniversary edition of their first album). He was heavily influenced by Pink Floyd and Sgt. Pepper. He has honestly worked on too many projects to list, so if I ever find myself looking for new music to listen to, I know where to go. This album is a pastiche of small, two track CDs released over the course of 2003- 2010. Each one would contain a cover of an existing song, as well as an original. Admittedly, I only recognize one of the covers: Sign O’ the Times by Prince. There is so much music out there that it is overwhelming! With this in mind, I am just going to enjoy the album for what it is and fill in the gaps later in life. The first tune, Thank You, is a cover of Alanis Morissette. The Day Before You Came is by ABBA, A Forest is by The Cure, The Guitar Lesson is by Momus, Sign O’ the Times is by Prince, and Lord of the Reedy River is by Donovan. This album is pretty cool. It feels like it has an acoustic/ folk base with progressive elements layered on top (largely, instrumentation and timbre elements). It has a very very distinct sound. It also seems as though the covers and originals are linked thematically (ie. The Forest vs. Four Trees Down).",
"This popped up in my Spotify Daily Feed, so here I am. They are an American Progressive Rock group that formed out of Los Angeles in 1992. Their name draws from a Star Trek episode (Mirror Mirror) in which Spock has a beard in a parallel universe. Neal and Alan Morse (the founding brothers) often used the term to refer to something weird or uncanny. Neal left shortly after the release of their first album Snow for religious reasons. I want to listen to snow (a double concept album about an albino that might be the messiah), but I would have to order it. It isn’t on Spotify. There have been a couple for staff turnovers since, but the band continues to record and tour to this day. They are considered by many to be on the forefront of new progressive rock. They draw from a pop influence, and they cite Yes and late period Genesis as sources of inspiration. This album, released in 2018, is their latest. In general, I can definitely hear the pop influence. The structure of the songs is pretty clear, and in general, there isn’t a lot of deviation from it. This isn’t a bad thing in the least, just an observation. I really like the tune Somebody’s Home. Beginnings is a really powerful tune. Overall I enjoyed the album. The whole thing sounds like what would happen if Chicago and Frost had a child. I think the progressive rock elements blend well with the lyrical style of Chicago, and I suspect that this album could become a favorite if I listened to it a few more times. Days We’ll Remember, for example, is basically an edgy Old Days. I dig it.",
"Graham recommended this album to me, and since time before classes start tomorrow, I’ve decided to check it out. I remember listening to this group with my dad when I was younger, but since I haven’t listened to any of their stuff since then, I don’t remember anything except the name and the tune 1979. The Pumpkins are an Alternative Rock group from Chicago, Illinois that was formed in 1988 by Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), Darcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums). The band has gone through a few lineup changes since then. Alternative rock formed in the 70’s and became popular in the 80’s. Alternative refers to its distinction from mainstream rock and its underground origins. It arose from an underground, Proto- Punk (precursor to punk) scene, and many consider The Velvet Underground & Nico by The Velvet Underground to be the first Alternative Rock album. The Replacements, for example, are also considered to be Alternative Rock. The Pumpkins, coming in at the tail end of this movement, are unique in the sense that they tended to reject the punk rock origins of many of their contemporaries. They instead relied on gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica influences. This led to a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound. Their initial career was largely reliant upon small tours and opening for other groups such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Janes Addiction, and Guns N Roses. This album, their second, launched them into the music mainstream. They broke up in 2000 due to internal conflicts and issues with drugs, but they reformed 2005. The period in between featured a few album releases, and they continue to write and perform to this day. This album, released in 1993, is considered by many to be one of the greatest albums of all time. It draws from diverse influences, and walks more along the line of progressive rock than punk or grunge. There were a lot of issues during the recording process, as the album was way behind schedule and over 250,000$ over budget. Corgen suffered a near nervous breakdown and planned his suicide for much of the recording process. His tyrannical and perfectionist anger also affected the other members of the group, leading to a very strained and mismanaged setting. This coupled with Corgan’s brief separation from his girlfriend led to very intense and troubling lyrics. He also wanted to create a sense of sonic depth without using delay or reverb, which led to very dense and layered arrangements. The album was praised by critics upon its release. Cherub Rock and Quiet were both bops, especially the latter. The third tune, Today, a sarcastic take on suicide, is one of their most popular. I definitely recognize this tune, and I dig it. It is really raw and powerful. It is ironic that such a tune represents a massive turning point in Corgan’s life, for it was this tune that allowed him to push onwards. Disarm was sooooo good. A beautiful tune addressing child abuse in an elegant way. Geek U.S.A is hailed for its complexity, like a runaway train. I like this tune a lot. It is like 50 Gerrits. Mayonnaise is another gorgeous tune about depression and moving past regret. The intro and outro are slightly reminiscent to the theme from Milk by Danny Elfman. I liked the tune Silverfuck a lot as well. It was all over the place, but I think that is the element that vibed with me the most. I love the tune Luna, a love song to the one who doesn’t love you back. So beautiful. I think I should look into this tune when I write my Siren’s Song. This whole album was full of amazing tunes. Definitely another winner for me. I will be listening to this again for sure.",
"I don’t remember where I heard about this album specifically, but here we are. It was released in 1974, and it is their seventh studio album. It is their lowest charting album of all time, but it has gone on to receive significant acclaim. Much of the album is based in improvisation. It was ok. I didn’t like it nearly as much as their first.",
"Megan Ihen once again posted about this on Facebook, so here I am. They are a new music vocal ensemble based out of New York City which focuses on performing lesser known, contemporary works. In particular, much of their focus falls into the realm of microtonality and non standard tuning systems. They have a long list of repertoire, and they have commissioned works from numerous composers all around the world. This album was released at the very beginning of this year. Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit. They reminded me a lot of Roomful of Teeth due to their extended vocal techniques. I would love to see some of these ideas integrated into a high school setting.",
"Dr. Smith mentioned this piece during Theory today as we were discussing whale song. It sounded interesting, so I decided to check it out. Hovhaness was an American composer of Armenia descent, and despite not having heard of him before today, he is considered to be one of the most prolific composers of his time. Surviving manuscripts indicate that he wrote over seventy symphonies, and his opus numbers reach up to 434 (although he has over 500 works since the opus numbers often count for two pieces). He was born in Massachusetts, and from a young age exhibited interest in Music and Astrology (many of his works are named after planets and stars). He travelled to Finland to meet Jean Sibelius, and the two remained in correspondence for many years. Hovhaness famously destroyed over 1000 of his earliest works in order to start anew with composition. Leonard Bernstein also referred to his first symphony as cheap ghetto music, so he once again burned many of his works. He held a post for some time at the Boston Conservatory, and he also gained the support of many other artists including John Cage and Martha Graham (a prominent choreographer at the time; I might consider looking into her a bit). He spent a fair amount of time abroad in Asia studying Japanese music, and he went on to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Rochester. This work, composed in 1970, is a symphonic poem which integrates recordings of whale song. The piece was not terribly well received after the premiere, and since Dr. Smith held the same opinion, I am curious to see what I will think. So I sort of agree with the critics, but sort of don’t. I think that the whale songs weren’t integrated into the orchestra well, and the imitations by the trombones came across as a little cheesy. That said, I did enjoy the imitations done by the violins, as well as the aleatoric elements present throughout. I would love to get my hands on a score of this to see how he notated it all. I might check the library here. I also want to check out his other well know poem Mysterious Mountain, and maybe a couple of his symphonies. I have a feeling I might like some of his other stuff.",
"I enjoyed this piece during theory today, so I wanted to log it. Part is an Estonian Composer of classical and religious works. He initially composed in a largely serialist style (the first in his country to do so), but in the late 70’s he switched over to a more minimalist style. He also invented a technique he frequently employs called tintinnabuli, or like the ringing of bells. It involves two voices, one of which moves diatonically, and the other which outlines the tonic chord. This style is a reflection of his obsession with secular Renaissance music. He composed very little during the period from 1968 to 1976, for the premiere of his Credo led to an unofficial censure of all his music. During this time he converted to Orthodox Christianity, and his emerging style reflected that, by and large. He is the most performed living composer in the world as of 2011. This piece is the first of his works to employ the tintinnabuli style. Composed in 1976, it was dedicated to a family friend’s daughter who had been separated from her Mother due to the Iron Curtain. The work was meant ot be a sort of consolation for the mother. The work is symmetrical in form, with each measure adding a new note to the pattern. The cardinality of these sets increases from two to eight before coming back down to two. The last measure has three notes, like a codetta of sorts. A very cool, simple little piece. I definitely want to listen to more of his music. Potentially Spiegel im Spiegel.",
"Another Music Theory Listening. This piece was written in 1974, and while highly chromatic, it draws its textural language from Bach. I really like this piece, and I might try playing it this semester.",
"Chanler was an American composer during the first half of the twentieth century. He was born in New Port, Rhode Island, but he soon after moved to Geneseo, New York. He is the godson of Theodore Roosevelt, and for a brief time, he studied with Nadia Boulanger. He is also a member of the Astor family, which is a line which achieved great prominence in North America and Europe during the 19th and 20th centuries (John Jacob Astor, for example, was one of the wealthiest people in human history). He is best known for his songs, which number at about fifty. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and he was a faculty member at both Peabody and Longy. This work, composed in 1939, is a setting of the English writer Walter de la Mare. The work depicts a couple reading tombstones at night. I dozed off around the fifth one, so I will have to listen to the, again tomorrow, but I really liked what I heard. The text was set in a very recitatif style (much like my text is laid out currently), with the piano serving to accent certain moments or expand ideas. I really did not hear a ton of melodic content in the piano parts. They were much more textural and supportive than anything. Very interesting. Stuff to chew on.",
"Corrine Byrne suggested this piece for us to check out during her residency with the Byrne:Kozar:Duo residency last week. I have listened to a bit of Berio before, but never this piece. I couldn’t find much info on the work other than what the composer himself had to say about it. It was written in 1949, and he described the work as his last exorcism. He was only twenty at the time WWII ended, and as facism in Italy came to fall, so did a lot of the artistic constraints placed upon its people. He was able to hear the music of Schönberg, Milhaud, Hindemith, Bartok, and Webern for the first time, and it was jarring for him finally understand his European culture fully. He said it took him six years to recover, and this piece was a part of that revival. Oddly, I could only find one recording of it on YouTube from two months ago. Its a decent recording, but I might consider checking NAXOS for a better one. I just checked, and it isn’t there. That is incredibly strange to me. This work must not be well known at all. I really dug this piece. I particularly liked the use of percussion in such a context. There were just a lot of really cool moments. The end reminded me a bit of Phillip Glass. Too bad this work isn’t preformed more often. It might work well in conjunction with a larger scale work, since the instrumentation is rather large for a shorter work. In any case, glad I found this piece.",
"Professor Sampson wanted me to check out the second tune on this album, but I’ve decided I want to just listen to the whole thing. Eighth Blackbird (stylized eighth blackbird until 2016) is an American contemporary music sextet based in Chicago, Illinois. The group consists of flute, clarinet, piano, percussion, violin, and cello (Pierrot ensemble with percussion, a name derived from Schoenbergs Pierrot Lunaire, which has that exact instrumentation). The group formed in 1996 out of Oberlin, and since then, they have gone on to win many awards. They are praised as being one of the best contemporary chamber ensembles in the world. Many of their shows are choreographed and memorized, and they frequently commission works from many of the world’s best known living composers, including Steve Reich, David Lang, Frederic Rzewski, and Jeniffer Higdon. This album, released in 2006, includes works by Higdon, Gordon Fitzell, Steven Mackey, David Gordon, and Dennis DeSantis. I really liked the second tune, Violence: violence by Gordon Fitzell. There were definitely a few parts that had the same effect on me as Ligeti’s Requiem. The extended techniques stopped sounding like instruments, turning into large, mysterious jungle creatures. The rest of the album was pretty wild as well. All very atmospheric, or as Ritual Action would say, more of an experience than a piece.",
"Graham introduced me to this group, since he wants to play one of the tunes off this album on his senior recital. They are a jazz trio based in Manchester, UK (having formed in 2012). Their music draws from a variety of styles, including jazz, rock, electronica, hip hop, minimalism, and classical music. Critics have compared their music to the likes of Aphex Twins, Brian Eno, Debussy, Shostakovich, and Phillip Glass. This album, released in 2016, was their third album. The title refers to a fascination amongst the band members with technologically motivated human augmentation. The album was well received by critics. One thing that is immediately noticeable about their music is the degree of rhythmic complexity within a simple structure. What I mean is a lot of the ostinatos found in the piano and sometimes the drums cusp on the edge of lopsided 7’s and 8’s, yet they always manage to lock into simple 3’s and 4’s so elegantly. This is especially true of the second track, which is damn near impossible to count during the first minute. Then, as soon as the rhythm section enters, it magically fits into 4. I really like this element of their music, and it this very device which allows me to understand why people draw parallels to minimalist style. I would argue that it is more Totalist due to its heightened degree of rhythmic complexity, but in any case, the parallel is very clear. I’ve also noticed that every track on this album ends in roughly the same way- the piano sustains a solo chord before cutting it short with a quick release. I don’t know what they are trying to say with this, but I love the sense of unity it gives the whole album. It’s such a small detail, but I always love that kind of stuff. Overall, I absolutely loved this album. I would love to see these guys live. It looks like their latest album was released in 2018, so I will definitely have to check that out sometime soon.",
"I’ve heard of this group through high school bands (Birdland, duh), but I’ve never actually listened to any of their music. This popped up in my spotify feed, so I decided I would give them a listen. Weather Report was an American Jazz Fusion group of the 70’s and early 80’s. Alongside Miles Davis’s electric groups and Return to Forever (both of which I really like), they are considered to be one of the preeminent jazz fusion groups. Joe Zawinal was the leader of the group for most of its existence, but aside from him and saxophonist Wayne Shorter, the group underwent a lot of other staff changes. Most notably, Jaco Pastorious was the lead bassist for quite some time. In their early years, they were a very avant- garde group leaning towards the stylings of stuff like Miles Davis’s late period albums. Zawinul took over the group after a few years, and he began steering the group in a more Funk/ R&B/ World influenced sound. The group split up after Shorter left the band in 86’. Zawinul did an updated take of the group (Weather Update), but its career was short lived. He went on to start his own group independent of Weather Report, and enjoyed a successful career until his death in 2007. Four of the bands members have died since the breakup. This album, released in 1977, is their eighth and most successful album. It was created in the midst of their jazz- rock stage, which followed their earlier, more avant garde music. Having Jaco on bass suited this busier, more conversational style. The thing I immediately notice about this album, especially Birdland, is just how synth heavy it is. This never translates well to high school arrangements, but it is still interesting nonetheless. The album was ok, but I didn’t enjoy it as much as I thought I was going to. There were definitely some really cool tunes, but to me, it sounds kinda dry for some reason. Birdland was the only tune that really locked in for me, but that might be a function of instrumentation. I might not like it a ton because the first two tunes set a really exciting precedent for the rest of the album, but then it didn’t deliver how I was hoping. The pieces felt like they dragged on sometimes, and especially with all of these synth heavy and rhythmic elements, I was hoping for something that locked in and stayed locked in. I might have to relisten to this one. That might reform my opinion.",
"Andy from Ritual Action suggested I check out this group. Deafheaven is an American Post- Metal group that formed out of San Francisco in 2010. Post- Metal is a style which arose in the 90’s, and it is characterized by metal roots with experimentation outside of the genre’s conventions. The group initially started as a duo, but they expanded and went on tour. It was during this time that they developed their sound and became more well known. This album, released in 2013, is their second. At the time, there were three band members (George Clarke, Kerry McCoy, and Dan Tracy). The album draws influence from black metal, shoegazing, post- rock, and alternative rock. The album was released to universal praise, becoming the best reviewed album of the year. Clarke stated that the album is meant to be experienced in one continuos sitting. I don’t think the work is a concept album in the strictest sense, but I will have to see as I listen. It is also worth mentioning that the cover art is supposed to resemble to colors one sees while laying in the sun with their eyes closed. I thought that was kinda neat. Initial impressions aren’t exceedingly amazing. It might not be an issue with the band itself, but more with the style. I have always been bad with hearing lyrics, but in this case, there is no way in hell you would be able to hear them without the writing right in front of you. I suppose this raises a rather interesting question regarding the importance of the lyrics, but for me personally, I would like to hear them if they are there. I don’t really understand the point on a macroscopic scale of writing these beautiful lyrics that no one will ever be able to hear. There is potential for beauty in that statement, but I don’t think the concept fits here. Another problem I have with the album is that it is full throttle all the time. My reservations on this matter might simply be due to my lack of familiarity with the style, but I found that there was very little gratifying about this music. There was no sense of tension and release in any way, textural, harmonic, melodic, or otherwise. It was Wall of Sound for the sake of being Wall of Sound. For me it approached the analytical maximum, and I would rather have just listened to white noise. The only times I felt any sort of musical response was during the interludes, which were shorter fragments that slightly contrasted the rest of the tracks. There were certainly moments here and there that I enjoyed, but overall, I was not a fan of this album at all. I couldn’t even finish it.",
"We talked about this piece in Theory today, so I thought I would give it a listen. Delius was an English composer active during the mid 19th century to early 20th. He spent a bit of time in Florida (where he is said to have fathered an illegitimate son), and it was the African American spirituals there which inspired him to compose. He contracted syphilis around 1980 and went blind as well as paralyzed. He drew inspiration from Wagner, Grieg, as well as his time in the states. He was only intermittently popular, but he has a very unique sound which Dr. Smith compared to the Impressionism occuring in France around that time. This work, written in 1931, is one such work dictated to his amanuensis. It is a short orchestral work depicting the stillness of a summer day, and it later became the title to a biographical film. This piece was ok. It definitely sounded incredibly Impressionistic. The main theme was very appealing, but I felt as though the work was a tad long winded. Thats just personal preference, though.",
"Some more Pumpkins, since I liked Siamese Dream so much. This album, released in 2012, is one of their most recent. It was originally intended to be released as a series of singles (since Corgan thought the album medium was dead), but they eventually opted back into the album form due to a lack of penetration. The album reflects themes of social identity (specifically romantic) in an increasingly technological society. The album was released to generally positive reception, with many stating that it was their best album since Siamese Dream. It is their seventh top ten album (on the Billboard 200). This album is much lighter than Siamese Dream, but I dig it a lot. There are times where it almost sounds like Harry Styles, especially the tune One Diamond, One Heart. Regarding Corgans statement about social identity in technology- I think he is more so referring to the context of the albums release rather than its actual lyrical content. This might explain the lighter style as well. He said himself that he wanted to connect with people on a more emotional level. Admittedly, Pumpkins lyrics can be tricky to figure out. I think they are left largely open and up for interpretation (which is very prog rock of them). There are definitely certain tunes/ moments where the meaning is super clear (such as Pale Horse), but other times it can be taken however one wants it to be taken. Another point of interest is how similar it sounds to their first album, despite being released nearly twenty years later. Overall I enjoyed this album. I think I like the heavier sound of Siamese Dream a bit better, but this is still a strong album. Definitely some tunes I would listen to again.",
"Professor Sampson suggested I check out this piece, although I don’t remember the context of the recommendation. In any case, Fagerlund is a living Finnish Composer. He is often described as a post- modern impressionist, and his music ranges from chamber ensemble and solo works to orchestral pieces. He is also one of the founders of the RUSK Chamber Music Festival. This work, a short piece for solo bassoon was first premiered in 2012. I could not find any other information on it, but it might prove useful as I continue writing the bassoon part for the choreography collaboration. This was a pretty wild piece. I was really taken aback by how seamless the transitions through the instruments various ranges was. Granted this is a very good player, but it still proves to me that such versatility is very doable. I also really enjoyed some of the pitch bending and multiphonics. There were a few in there that were incredibly stable, and that might be something to ask Sampson about (since she really did write the book on it). I also think I heard some flutter tonguing in there, and that was super cool. We also discussed overpressure for the violin, and I felt as though I heard something somewhat similar in here. I’m not sure what it was, but its yet another thing to ask Sampson about. A very cool piece. I definitely want to check out some of his orchestral works now. Maybe a concerto or something.",
"This is the other piece by Fagerlund that Professor Sampson suggested I listen to. It seems as though it was written around 2014, but I am not completely sure of that. It is a bassoon concerto, so this works out well with my hopes for listening to one of his. It is worth mentioning that I was able to find the bassoon part sheet music online, and while I am not going to read along while listening, it could serve as an excellent point of notational reference for interesting things I might hear. All I can say is that this piece is exceedingly awesome. Easily one of my new favorite orchestral works. It is just so dang colorful, and the bassoon’s extended techniques blend soooooo well with the rest of the ensemble. One thing in particular that I noticed was that climaxes were more powerful when the bassoon hit the lower and of its register. I have been in this mindset that I need to work upwards in the bassoon to climax, but it makes way more sense to have it in that lower, angry register for the defining violent moment. Especially with things like flutter tonguing and multiphonics, it has a ton of potential to be really cool. On a separate but related note, the orchestration of this piece is totally phenomenal. I would love to get my hands on a copy of the score so I can see exactly what he is doing. There are just so many colorful and amazing textures. If Fantasia ever gets a redo, I would love to see this piece make it in there. Absolutely incredible.",
"I’ve been on a pretty big Talking Heads lately, and since I have always like the album David Byrne did with St. Vincent, I thought I would check out some of his solo career. Byrne was born in Scotland, but soon moved to America where his father’s electrical engineering skills were in high demand. He attended both the Rhode Island School of Design and the Maryland Institute of College for architecture before dropping it. It was here that he met Chris Frantz, which soon led to the formation of the Talking Heads. The heads were active in the New York City scen up until 1991 when they broke up. It was at this point that Byrne began collaborating with Brian Eno on a multitude of solo and collaborative projects. There are too many to liste, but a main takeaway is that he was involved with a lot of stuff outside of music. He has written a plethora of books, he is an avid cyclist, he has done some filmmaking and acting, and my favorite is his conversion of the Battery Maritime building into a playable music art instillation called Playing the Building. He has also given a Ted Talk on the influence of architecture in music, and he also makes visual art as well. Super interesting stuff. He has truly done a lot of different and amazing creative things. This album, released in 1997, is Byren’s fifth solo album. The album was released to favorable reviews, and it is notable for his collaboration with the band Morcheeba and the ensemble Black Cat Orchestra. This whole album was pretty weird. It felt a lot like the Talking Heads on LSD, but the Talking Heads already kinda sound like LSD sometimes, so I don’t really know how to feel about it. All I know for sure is that the effects don’t cancel. That said, this is definitely something I could see myself getting into. It is definitely strange, but there are also some really cool moments. I particularly liked the tune Dance on Vaseline. I have always thought that David Byrne was an eccentric guy, and this only proves that.",
"This is their fourth album, released in 2014 to favorable reviews. I enjoyed this album. I didn’t give it a really deep listen since I was working on some other stuff at the same time, but it was really nice to have on in the background. This group has a very distinct sound, and while this album was certainly similar to Man Made Object, it existed well as a separate entity. I really enjoy their quasi- minimalistic take on jazz. They are a group I would love to see live.",
"This album also comes per the recommendation of the Bassoonist from Ritual Action. He also recommended the Deaf Heaven album, and while I did not enjoy that, I am hopeful that I will find something cool in this one. G?G! is a math rock duo formed out of Massachusetts in 2001 by Kenneth Topham and Joseph Andreoli. Math Rock is a style of rock characterized by complex structures, extended harmonies, asymmetrical meters, and minimalist influence from composers such as Steve Reich. It is similar to Post- Rock, which is a style that seeks to expand on rock’s traditional forms and structures. Math Rock found its beginnings in the music of groups like King Crimson and Rush. They released their first album in 2005 from a warehouse in Santa Cruz, California. They state they record as much of their music live as they can with only a minimal number of overdubs. They also state that they only record things which they can perform live. I find this to be incredibly interesting, given the style of their music and the size of their group. I am very curious to see how it reflects on the album (of which this is their fourth, released in 2018). I really really liked this album. I can see how the two of them would play all of this live using looping pedals. The whole thing was instrumental (except for the last track), yet the titles of the album and tracks gave it an almost nostalgic sort of concept. I couldn’t pick out the lyrics, but they gave the last track a really distinct and beautiful character. After reading into it, I found that the album is actually built around thirty six chapters which bleed into one another over the course of the six tracks. I couldn’t find any information about the meaning of the chapters or their source, but I still find it to be super interesting. I definitely want to check out more of their stuff. I have heard that their second album, More Skin with Milkmouth, is a must hear for math rock.",
"So I have heard piece of this work before, but I have neglected to sit down and listen to the whole thing. Since I want to draw from it for my orchestral project, I figured now would be a good time. This piece, written in 1912, is arguably one of his most important works. It is a setting of 21 (3x7) poems by Albert Giraud. A Pierrot is a stock character of late 17th century Italian Comic Opera. Thus, the title translates roughly as Moonstruck Pantomime. The work is rooted firmly in the Expressionist style, which seeks to explore the emotion of a scene rather than a realistic depiction of it. This work actually predates his Twelve Tone Serialist Techniques of 1921, and as such falls into his Free Atonality period. In this system, there is no system. Every note functions completely independent of the others, with no system of hierarchy defining them. This piece employs the sprechstimme style of recitation, which blurs the line between speaking and singing. The piece’s instrumentation (flute, clarinet, violin, cello, and piano), became a standard ensemble known as the Pierrot Ensemble. Pierrot lunaire consists of three groups of seven poems. In the first group, Pierrot sings of love, sex and religion; in the second, of violence, crime, and blasphemy; and in the third of his return home to Bergamo, with his past haunting him (Wikipedia). I am interested to see if there is a noticeable contrast between these sections. I am going to listen without text this first time, but I will listen again with text sometime in the near future. I really enjoyed this work. It is super colorful the whole time, and despite its free atonality, there were a lot of melodic fragments that were super easy to latch onto. The whole thing had this almost fever dream sort of sound that was really exciting and unsettling. I really liked it, and I definitely want to follow along with a score and get some ideas.",
"Sampson said I should check out this piece, so I am going to listen while I play minecraft. Corigliano is an American classical composer. He is the composer in residence for the Chicago Symphony, and he was an assistant producer for Bernstein’s Young People’s Concerts. He was also the concertmaster for the New York Phil for 26 years, and he is now a faculty composer at the Julliard school. He has won a Guggenheim Fellowship, an Oscar, and the Pulitzer Prize. He is best known for his second symphony, his score to The Red Violin, and his Clarinet Concerto. He also taught Eric Whitacre, Steve Bryant, Nico Muhly, and John Mackey. This piece, written in 1989 during his tenure with the Chicago Symphony, is a work commemorating those friends he lost during the AIDS epidemic. The first three movements are dedicated to specific individuals (a pianist, a music executive, and a cellist), with the final movement tying together themes from all three over the backdrop of a tireless onslaught of chords in the strings and brass. The first movement specifically quotes Issac Albeniz’s Tango in D, a favorite of his friend. Overall I enjoyed the piece, although I am going to want to give it a more thorough listen. It was very angry, and I really enjoyed the auxiliary percussion stuff.",
"So a lot has happened since my last log. The world has plunged into darkness, and we are all doomed to a slow and painful death. Well, not entirely, but things do kind of suck right now. With that in mind, it was super refreshing to watch a dystopian film with a satirical take. This film was released in 2018 under the direction of Wes Anderson (who also did The Grand Budapest Hotel, Fantastic Mr. Fox, Moonrise Kingdom, et cetera). It was a German and US collabeaturing a star studded cast and elaborate stop motion animation. The film follows the story of a pack of banished dogs, led by street dog Chief (Bryan Cranston), who helps a young boy named Atari (Koyu Rankin) search for his own dog after the species is banished to an island following the outbreak of a canine flu. The film is simultaneously dark, funny, touching, macabre, and beautiful. The accompanying score was also fascinating for many reasons. Desplat is a French film composer who has worked on quite a few of Wes Anderson’s other movies. He also composed some other blockbuster scores, including some of the Harry Potter films, one of the newer Star Wars, and a personal favorite, the Imitation Game. It is also worth mentioning that he studied with Iannis Xenakis, which I find to be fascinating. His filmography is quite large, and I definitely want to check out some more films in this vein. It is interesting to listen to this soundtrack outside of the context of the film. One thing very apparent when viewing the film is the association between percussive elements and humans, almost like an instrumental motif. Part of me thinks this is to reflect the barbaric nature of many of the people in this film, but another part of me thinks it is just a device used to build tension and anticipation. This is certainly evident towards the end of the film, as the Little Pilot makes his case for dogs to everyone. It may very well be both. In any case, I was impressed with the variety of textures and moods Desplat was able to achieve with only percussion. By shifting the rhythms around into different types of percussive instruments, he was able to effectively alter our perception of those motifs. This is also apparent with the motif that Spots whistles to the Little Pilot. In the track Six Months Later + Dog Fight, that motif is recontextualized harmonically and orchestrational to convey an entirely different atmosphere. In a more general sense, one thing that was super refreshing about this whole film and the soundtrack was that it didn’t seem to take itself to seriously. The movie itself is, in essence, a satirical take on dystopian films, and the soundtrack accurately reflects this. In it’s avoidance of large orchestral writing and cliche motifs, it was able to portray an equally scary yet hysterical reality. Everything from the wonky stop motion animation to the deadpan dialogue and music just melded really well.",
"Louis Andriessen is a Dutch composer based out of Amsterdam. He was born to a musical family, and he studied under Luciano Berio. He also helped establish the Studio for Electro Instrumental Music (STEIM) in Amsterdam, similar to Berio’s establishment of Studio di fonologia musicale in Italy. Andriessen has dabbled with many of Western contemporary classic music’s evolutions, including drawing influences from American jazz. This eclectic mix of influences has synthesized into a very unique style. This work, composed in 1991 for Bang on a Can, is for  tenor saxophone, electric guitar, piano and marimba. It extensively features a canon at the sixteenth note, making the whole piece sound like it has heavy delay applied to it. I absolutely love this sound, and it is something I should definitely consider experimenting with in the near future.",
"Since I feel like doing absolutely nothing today, I’ve decided to at least get some listening in. I listened to his Eighth Quartet twice this week (yes, it is that good), and I relistened to the first yesterday. Since I haven’t heard this one before, I decided to start here. It was composed in 1944 in just nineteen days. Interestingly enough, he had already composed fifteen symphonies and was halfway through his life at this point. The other thirteen quartets would follow in quick succession. This is the longest of his quartets, next to the final fifteenth. I was not expecting a recitative after the first movement. It screamed Scheherezade to me, and I quite liked it. Shosty’s string quartets are so interesting to me. They definitely have some pretty complex stuff happening a lot of the time, but there is always this element of sweet simplicity about them. I always find myself getting lost in the textures he manages to come up with. They never feel dull or monotonous. I could easily see a lot of these quartets being fully orchestrated just due to to how well he scores for the quartet. I think this recitatif alone is going to turn me on to Phrygian. It’s so tasty. This should be taught as a study in chromatic solfege. And the ending to that movement! I completely forgot we were in Bb Major, since it has been droning on that F for so long. That Plagal cadence at the end caught me off guard, yet my ears were subconsciously expecting it. I’m a big fan. I find it interesting that he had the whole third movement con sordiNumber He easily could have had them playing without mutes, especially given how aggressive and edgy the movement was, but I quite liked the more rounded sound. It also mae the transition into the senza sordino fourth movement much more jarring than it would have been otherwise.",
"Blake recommended this album to me after I started posting my ten daily albums. He sad it really changed him musically, so I decided to give it a listen. CHON is a progressive rock and math rock band of four members from Oceanside, California. They formed in 2008, and they continue to record and play live to this day. They are largely an instrumental group, with only a few tunes containing lyrics. This is their 2013, self released EP. It consists of eight short tracks. I really liked this EP. It reminded me a bit of stuff by Animals as Leaders or Giraffe??Giraffe!!, but a bit less heavy. Super cool. I could definitely see myself getting into Math Rock.",
"Some more Mars Volta. This is their sixth studio album, released in 2012. Cedric Bixler said the album was based off the Greek myth of Hyacinthus (the male love of Apollo, who was fatally wounded by a discus and had a memorial flower built after his likeness), and the nursery rhyme Solomon Grundy (Solomon Grundy, Born on a Monday, Christened on Tuesday, Married on Wednesday, Took ill on Thursday, Grew worse on Friday, Died on Saturday, Buried on Sunday, That was the end, Of Solomon Grundy). Cedric also stated that the album is about Embracing life for what it should be. The album featured much less input from the other bandmates than was seen in prior works, and as such it is often viewed as the end of an era for the Mars Volta. Cedric strove to be more concise with this album, and also wanted less focus on the guitars. The album was met with mostly positive reception. Overall a decent album, although, like with most Mars Volta albums, I have a hard time really getting into it. I think the concept of telling a story in the purest way through music is fascinating, but, especially given my difficulty with picking out lyrics, it doesn’t always translate terribly well for me. I have to really dig into the lyrics online to get the full effect, and even then, I feel as though a lot is lost. That said, I still quite enjoy the music itself. It is so characteristically Mars Volta from a vocal standpoint, and from the instrumental side this album definitely sounds much less guitar heavy.",
"Time for some more Faure, this time as an assignment for collaborative piaNumber I traced the roots of French Impressionism my first semester at Fredonia, and being the teacher of Ravel and Nadia, I naturally ran across him. I listened to his Pavane and Requiem (both truly beautiful works), as well as his song Apres un reve. This work, composed between 1892 and 1894, is a cycle of nine melodies for voice and piaNumber In 1898 he expanded the instrumentation to include string quintet as well. The work is cyclical, with the five primary themes (one of which is borrowed from his song Lydia) come together during the final movement. The work was a spontaneous composition, and Emma Bardac sang the new material he wrote everyday during his summers as the guest of her husband. He was in love with her at the time, but she later went on to marry Debussy. The text is from a collection of 21 poems by Verlaine, but their appearance in the cycle does not correspond to their order in the set. The translation of each poems seem to generally reflect themes of love and nature, and I don’t think there is a better way of showing the bridge between Romanticism and Impressionism than that. Overall I liked this work. As someone who struggles with writing interesting piano textures, I am always impressed by other composers who seem to manage is so flawlessly. I also find it interesting to see the parallel between his writing and that of Lili’s and Ravel’s, both of whom he had a relatively close connection with. I also listened to his arrangement with string quintet, and clearly I prefer that one. The piano version has its own unique charm, but I always love when colors can be diversified. The strings just add such a nice layer to things.",
"Frost’s Spotify page led me to these guys, so I thought I would check them out. They are a German prog rock group that formed in 1997. The initially started as a Pink Floyd cover band, but quickly expanded into original composition performance. Their debut album, God has Failed, was released in 2000 to international acclaim. This album, released in 2012, is a concept album inspired by Thus Spoke Zarathustra (the title coming from the final line, 6,000 feet beyond mand and time). Much like the book, the album follows a protagonist as he meets various characters and gleams insight from them. Supposedly, each character has a leitmotif, so I am excited to see if I can hear that translate. I really dug this album. It was like Frost meets folk pOpus  The whole thing was super laid back and easy to listen to. The mastering was excellent. Everything felt really well placed and balanced in the stereo field, and there was never one element that felt too overpowering. I also found that the lyrics scanned super well, and this combined with Yogi Lang’s incredible diction led to a clarity I don’t often here in this stye. I’m glad that I read Zarathustra before hearing this, because it is sooooooooo Neitzche. A lot of the themes in that book really resonate with me, so naturally this was a very interesting album to experience. There were a lot of parts that screamed Supper’s Ready, especially the track The Fisherman. The only real criticism I have personally was that a lot of it felt excessively repetitive, and the vocal part never really pushed to expand out of a comfortable and well defined range. Then again, this is a very meditative work with a heavy pop influence, so even those critiques can be justified. I thought the whole thing worked pretty well, and I am definitely interested to check out more of their stuff. I think Dylan would really like this album.",
"I saw this one Facebook, and it seemed pretty cool. Lonely Robot is an English Progressive Rock project started by John Mitchell, a founding member of Frost. It is a trilogy of albums released over four years which centers around an astronaut, which Mitchell describes as representative of the human condition. This is the last album in the series, so I will definitely have to check out the other two at some point. The thing that stuck out to me most about this is the fact that the entire album has an accompanying animation, so I am excited to see how that translates.  It is also worth mentioning that the label this album is under, Inside Out Music, also handles Frost, Dream Theatre, Spock’s Beard, and Steve Hackett. Overall pretty cool. I must admit that I drifted in and out of consciousness through the whole thing, but it was very conducive to that. The whole thing was very ambient and synthy with a lot of repeating chord and melody patterns. I didn’t like it as much as some of the other stuff I have heard from Inside Out, but it was still very enjoyable. The label certainly has a very distinct sound.",
"I need some listening to occupy me on this rainy Sunday while I orchestrate, so I’ve decided to finally check out this album. Cam had me transcribing a rhythm from one of the tunes, and I know that Derek has wanted me to check these guys out for quite a while. They are an American Instrumental Ensemble formed by bassist Michael League in 2004. Although they are often described as a jazz fusion band, League tends to think of them as a pop group that improvises a lot. In any case, they are a really tight ensemble that has performed with a wide variety of musicians from incredibly eclectic musical backgrounds. They originally formed with ten people, but the core now boasts nineteen people which play on and off depending on when and where a gig is. This leads to a very dynamic sound which changes from venue to venue and album to album. Despite this (or maybe even because of this), the group has released thirteen albums and has won three Grammys. This album was released in 2014, and the last track includes a synth solo by Cory Henry. I really liked this album. It had a density about it that was still easy enough to listen to in passing, and the mixing of styles was definitely apparent. I will be keeping my eyes open for shows.",
"Tyler has been suggesting this album for quite a while now, so I’m gonna listen while I mine. Pretty interesting group. They formed in 1990 in California, and they crossed a lot of genres over their career. They started as pretty much straight metal, but then they shifted into Prog Rock, and then soon thereafter Art Rock. This is best exemplified by their attempts to unify all aspects of their work, from the music to the visuals. They have been the center of a lot of censorship controversy due to the subject matters they touch upon, and they are also firmly dedicated to the privacy of the band members. They currently have five studio albums, and EP, and a box set. This album, released in 2001, represents a diversion into a more Prog Rock sound. They initially teased the album under a false title in protest of music sharing sites like Napster. The album was met with immense acclaim, and is considered a staple of the genre. Much of the album is structured around numerology, with themes reflecting the desire of mankind to learn more. This is reflected in the album art, which depicts a peeled away man with third eyes at the center of an outward spiral. In particular, the track Lateralus has meter changes structured around the 16th integer of the Fibonacci sequence (987). It is also worth mentioning that they toured with King Crimson briefly after this album released, with many calling them the present and future kings of Prog Rock. I didn’t get a chance to finish this log after I listened to the album, but I am still listening to it a week later. This shit slaps. Such a cool album, and I definitely need to check out some of their other stuff.",
"Since I am beginning a dive into songwriting, John Tocco suggested I check out some of the greats. James Taylor certainly fits that category, as he is one of the best selling American artists of all time. He was born into an affluent Northeastern family. His father was a physician, and his mother studied singing at the New England Conservatory. He picked up guitar in the 60’s after taking cello lessons for quite some time, and he frequently collaborated with  Danny Kortchmar (a respected figure in the singer- songwriter community). Towards the end of his boarding school career, he admitted himself to a mental institution for nine months. He said the experience was incredibly healing, and became an integral part of his life. After that, he moved to NYC in hopes of starting a band. He had a couple tunes chart, but spiraled into a heroine addiction. His father brought him back to North Carolina, where he spent six months recovering. After that, he sent a demo to Peter Asher (A&R for the Beatles label Apple). Paul and George heard the tape, and immediately got them to sign Taylor. He fell back into his heroine addiction, and was hospitalized during the release of his first album (which was met with generally favorable reviews). After his recovery, he moved to California and released this album, Sweet Baby James, in 1970. His career had many more ups and downs after that point, but this was his big breakthrough. He was essentially homeless at the time, and the album was finished at 7,600$ of a 20,000$ budget (in fact, the tune Suite for 20 G is a poke to this). The album also features the talent of Danny Kortchmar and Carole King, another successful singer songwriter who was on the Brill Building Staff for quite some time. The second tune does something cool. The first verse sounds like it is in 8/4 (3+3+2), but then the chorus locks into a solid 4/4 hypermeter. This continues for the rest of the tune. Reminds me of 1979 by the Smashing Pumpkins, where the intro sounds like onbeats, but then the verse shows they are offbeats. In fact, the next tune Sunny Skies is a lot like Today in its juxtaposition of a somber subject matter with a cheerful musical character. Steamroller Blues had me in stitches. So satirical, I love it. Fire and Rain, one of his most successful tunes, is a beautiful song about recovering from the death of a loved one. Super touching. I also liked the reference to the death of his band The Flying Machines. Overall, this album was just so good. I can’t believe I have been missing it all my life. Definitely going to be giving it quite a few good, thorough listens.",
"Another recommendation from John. He described Folds as a sad John Lennon, and since I quite like Lennon, I am interested to see what I think. Folds is an American sinder, pianist, composer, and record producer. His career is quite eclectic, and he is worked with a lot of big names. He produced Amanda Palmer’s first album, and he also frequently collaborates with Weird Al Yankovic and William Shatner. He composed music for Over the Hedge and Hoodwinked, and he also made a cameo in We’re the Millers (if I ever watch that stupid movie again, I will have to keep an eye out for it). He was initially in a group called the Ben Folds Five during the mid 90’s. They released quite a few albums up until the end of the century, where they took a long hiatus. They occasionally reunite. This album was his first solo album, as well as his first work after leaving the Ben Folds Five. It was released on September 11, 2001- the same day as the attacks. It was released to positive reception, and the title track was featured in Over the Hedge (where William Shatner stars as the Opossum). Still Fightin’ It really hit home for some reason. Carrying Cathy made me cry, pretty badly. Rockin’ Suburbs was hilarious, and definitely verrrrrry different from what made it into the movie. Luckiest is just straight up gorgeous. Overall, I absolutely fucking loved this album. It’s like Elton John had a child with the Talking Heads and Wierd Al. It was funny where it needed to be, and sarcastic where it counted. The lyrics are soooooo simple, but they don’t need to be anything but. Lovely.",
"Yet another album from John, since he seems to have excellent ears for this sort of stuff. Melissa Jefferson, known professionally as Lizzo, is an American rapper, singer, and actress. She began rapping at a young age, and she studied flute at college briefly before the death of her father when she was 21. From then on, she lived out of her car trying to break into the music scene. She had somewhat of a meteoric rise to fame, as she spent the early part of the 2010’s appearing on T.V. shows, releasing music, and playing roles in the occasional film. It was this album, released in 2019, which was the turning point for her career. It produced two singles (Juice and Tempo) which were enormously popular. It is her third and latest studio album, and it features appearances by Missy Elliot, Ariana Grande, and Gucci Mane. The album cover is also worth bringing up, as her nude posing further bolsters her messages of body positivity. It was an awesome album. Just slapped the whole way through. Definitely very different from what I am used to listening to, but I definitely enjoyed it. Really reaffirmed the importance of a strong hook in a lot of popular genres.",
"In memory of Little Richard, who passed away only three days ago, John Tocco suggested I check out this album. Obviously I’ve heard of Little Richard, but since I am not familiar with his work, I figured this would be a good jumping off point. Richard Penniman was an American singer, songwriter, and musician. The most influential of his work came out in the mid 1950’s, earning him the title of Architect of Rock and Roll. He is also considered to be one of the first crossover black artists, as his work reached a wide, varied audience. After his massive success in the 50’s, he took a five year hiatus and wrote largely religious music. From that point on, he had periodic returns to secular music up until his death in 2020. He had a drug problem for much of his life, and also struggled with his sexual identity and voyeurism. His music introduced many of the key elements of 60’s rock, including a heavier bassline, grittier vocals, verse- chorus form, and an even subdivision of rhythm across all tempos (as opposed to the shuffle feel of Boogie- Woogie). It is also worth mentioning that his style had immense influence on the Beatles, who sometimes opened for him and received instruction on how to emulate his vocal style. This album, release in 1957, is his debut album. It was an immediate success, and contains two of his most popular tunes (Long Tall Sally and Jenny, Jenny). I enjoyed this album a fair amount. I’ve never been a huge fan of the blues, but with such a distinct and energetic voice, it’s hard not to get into it. I also think the straight ahead rhythm that he helped develop really adds a lot. It’s just a lot of fun to listen to. I could see myself playing this on long summer drives.",
"Steve Hackett really needs no introduction. After his time with Genesis, he went on to become one of the most prolific figures in Progressive Rock, releasing numerous albums and collaborating with a multitude of artists. I’ve listened to his Tokyo Tapes and his Genesis Revisited albums, but I have yet to hear anything original. He discussed one of the tunes from this album on his YouTube channel, so I decided to give it a listen. It is his first studio album, and the only one released (in 1975) while he was still with Genesis. He was becoming frustrated with the arduous touring schedule for The Lamb, and writing these tunes became a sort of outlet for him. Recording commenced one month after the tour finished, and it was completed four weeks later. It is a loose concept album, with each track named after a Tarot card. It is also Hackett’s first attempt at playing keyboards, as he was trying to aim for a more layered sound. The album features Collins on drums and Rutherford on bass. The cover art is by a Brazilian artist named Kim Poor, who Hackett married and dedicated the album to. The album also features Steve’s younger brother John. Overall, this album was awesome. It was mostly instrumental, with the exception of a couple of the tunes. It gave me very late Peter gabriel era Genesis vibes, which makes a looooottttttt of sense. It definitely sounded like something that came directly off Foxtrot. I definitely dig it, and want to check out more of his non- Genesis stuff for sure.",
"I saw that this album released today, so I thought I would check it out. They are a Progressive Metal band from Australia that formed in 2011. They are part of the same record label as Frost, Steve Hackett, Spock’s Beard, Flower Kings, and Dream Theatre (Inside Out Music), which is how I heard about them. The name comes from the prized possession of Rome’s third emperor (Caligula’s horse Incitatus). This is their most recent album. Overall it was a pretty cool album. Definitely a bit heavier than what I am used to, but I still enjoyed it quite a bit. The band’s under this label definitely tend to have a characteristic sound that is still quite distinct. The vocals are all very well defined from band to band, yet very unique. The other thing that tends to stick out to me is the drums. The style is different across artists, but they tend to have very similar sounds. I know a few of these bands share musicians, so I am curious if they have any standardization in that regard. From a compositional standpoint, a lot of these tunes had really interesting grooves. The second track, Slow Violence, for example, was super cool. I don’t know exactly what is happening in it quite yet, but it’s definitely something interesting.",
"Graham has been suggesting this album to me for a while, so I’e decided to finally listen to it. Louis Cole is a member of the Jazz- Fusion group Knower, and this is his first solo album. I couldn’t find a lot of info on him, other than that he is a graduate of USC Thornton and a multi-instrumentalist. Cole and another musician from Southern California (Sam Gendel) are thought to be behind the surrealist, grindcore duo Clown Core. This album was super quirky, and I absolutely loved it. It gave me some heavy David Byrne vibes at times, but it was totally different in basically every other regard. It cusped into experimental electronic ambient stuff, as well as a dash of minimalism. Loved it.",
"Someone mentioned this album in the comments of Frost’s latest single (which was incredible), so I’ve decided to give it a listen. They are an art rock band from Norway which has been described by one critic as classical post ambient nocturnal atmospheric neo-progressive folk world rock. Their music has been compared to the likes of Radiohead and Porcupine Tree. The group formed in 1996 out of what they describe as an unlikely mix of people (which is where the got the band name from, since Gazpacho is the bastard of all soups). They seem to pride themselves on always producing unexpected music which surprises listeners. This album was released in 2015, and it is a concept album of the likes of Mars Volta. In it, a man decides he wants to turn to religion, but only if god is real. After learning about all of the world’s religions, he decides that God seems to be pretty much dead, and that existence is a convenient series of chemical reactions inside a meaningless void. He also decides that he would like to build a machine which is able to calculate all of these reactions, thus simulating all of time itself. He hopes that in doing so, he might be able to find a deity. He names the device after the demon Molok, which had children sacrificed to its jaws (due to the fact that the machine crunches numbers). He places it in the darkness of the Newgrange Tomb (an ancient, lightless relic in Ireland) and sets it to work. The machine sort of goes off the rails as it experiences the dawn of man and the birth of religion, and begins to undergo its own evolution. At the end, it instantly calculates the position of every electron in the universe, causing time to free and existence to collapse. A full description written by the band is below. This album was amazing. Just the right combination of everything I like in Progressive Rock music. Definitely gotta check out more of their stuff.",
"This album has become somewhat of a classic, and since I have neglected to listen to it for so long, I’m finally diving in. Released in 1972, this is the fifth studio album by Bowie (with Heroes being his twelfth), and it is the birthplace of his alter ego Ziggy. Ziggy is an androgynous (ambiguous gender) bisexual rockstar that is a messenger for extraterrestrial beings. The Spiders from Mars was Bowie’s backing band for many years. While the album cusps into rock opera and loose concept, many of the details are never mentioned. The tale of this work has been perpetuated over the years by fans and Bowie himself, who came to absorb the alter ego to such an extent that it began devastating his personality and making him question his sanity. The album was an immediate hit, and it propelled Bowie to stardom. He states influences from Lou Reed of the Velvet Underground, Jimi Hendrix, and King Crimson. For these reasons, it is also considered to be Proto- Punk. Overall, a cool album. From what I have heard, it is very David Bowie. It sounds almost like Mott the Hoople but Proggy, which makes sense given their lose collaborations and influences. Good stuff.",
"In the wake of the Minneapolis Protests, Ive decided to dedicate more time to black artists. The first place I thought to look was jazz, so I asked Derek for some recommendations. He has mentioned Sands a lot before, so I am happy to finally he getting around to him. He is an American jazz pianist born in 89. He began playing at a very young age, and quickly became a skilled player. He studied at MSM, and after graduation, joined bassist Christian McBrides ground Inside Straight. In 2012, he became a Steinway Artist. He considers his goal to be bringing new people into jazz while also pushing the style forward. This album was released in 2018. Overall a pretty hip album. The form and instrumentation of the tunes tends to be a bit more conservative, but a lot of the other stuff happening is certainly more contemporary in nature. I really enjoyed it for that reason, and Im looking forward to hearing more of his stuff.",
"Just a quick little bit about this. A short EP released on June 5th. I stayed up until midnight to listen, and I wasn’t disappointed. Some more amazing stuff from them. Very unlike anything they’ve written before, drawing a heavy influence from electronica. I dig it really hard, and I can’t wait for the 4th album.",
"I heard her on a single that Jacob Collier released recently, and I liked her voice so much that I thought I would check her out. She is a black female British singer and actress. She has released a couple of EP’s and two albums, and critics describe her music as Alternative R&B (because that’s a nice catch all for black music), neo soul, and hip hop soul. This album, released in 2019, is her most recent. It was a critical success. I really dug this album. It grooves hard, its easy to listen to, and the vocals are just stunning. I think I might be going on a Hip Hop kick.",
"Another recommendation from my boy Derek. Glasper is an American pianist and record producer toting three Grammys and one Emmy. He went to the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music in NYC, where his career as a pianist developed alongside Hip- Hope and Soul influences. He has worked with a plethora of musicians, including playing keys on These Walls from Lamar’s Butterfly. He also wrote the score to Miles Ahead, the 2015 film about Miles Davis. His career centers around his work as a solo artist and his two bands: The Robert Glasper Trio and the Robert Glasper Experiment (the latter of which is an electronic group which defies any sort of stylistic norms). This album, released in 2012, is his fifth studio album. It features the Robert Glasper Experiment, and it won a Grammy for best R&B album. It features a variety of covers in addition to original tunes by Glasper. Overall I enjoyed the album. It reminded me of Moonchild, but less white. Super easy to listen to.",
"An online acquaintance suggested I check out this album. I’ve heard of the 1975 before, but I am not familiar with their work. They are a British Pop Rock band which formed in 2002. The group consists of Matthew Healy, Adam Hann, Ross MacDonald, and George Daniel. They originally started gigging in high school, and their name comes from the book On the Road by Jack Kerouac. Interestingly enough, they didn’t release their self- titled debut album until 2013. They produced it in collaboration with Mike Crossey, who frequently works with the Arctic Monkeys. It was a massive success, and since then, they have released three more albums (the latest of which, Notes on a Conditional Form,  released in May 2020, features Greta Thurnberg on one of the singles). Despite this, public reaction to the band has been mixed. One critic described them as both overhyped and underrated. I’m interested to see how that translates to this album, their second which was released in 2016. The band cites the Talking Heads as inspiration, as well as a plethora of other pop rock, indie rock, and new wave groups. Many consider it to be one of the best albums of 2016.",
"This album popped up on my Facebook, so I decided to check it out. There is not a lot of information on the group at all, but I managed to scrounge up something on a progressive rock website. The band is more of a project formed by Michał Wojtas in 1999. He had played in a variety of other Polish groups for a time, but after studying music in college, he decided to record a demo. It is largely a solo project, although the albums often feature collaborations with various other musicians. They released quite a few albums before going on a hiatus between 2005 and 2017. This album, released two years ago today (June 23), represents their return to the musical scene. I need to forgive my past self if this information isn’t 100% accurate, since the group isn’t well known at all, and much of their documentation is in Polish. Overall I liked this album. It was very atmospheric and reminiscent of RWPL and Gazpacho. I’m definitely going to keep my eyes out for them.",
"I listened to this album today at work, largely because it was released so recently and because of its cover art (teddy bears with their heads in the sand). Airbag is a Prog Rock group from Norway, formed in the mid 2000’s. The started with a string of successful EP’s before signing to Karisma Records. From what I can tell, this is their 5th album. Overall I enjoyed it quite a bit. It had the heavy atmospheric trends of stuff by Porcupine Tree with the vocal style of Gazpacho. Definitely an album I want to listen to again, with fresher ears.",
"Marianne wants me to listen to this for some reason, so despite my aversion to Classical Period music, here I am. This is a four part secular oratorio first performed in 1801, towards the end of his life in 1809. He was pushed to write it after the widespread success of his 1798 religious oratorio The Creation, which was receiving widespread performances all over Europe. The libretto was written by the same guy, Gottfried van Swieten, who was in turn drawing from the eponymous poem by James Thomson. Due to Haydn’s declining health, the composition process was quite arduous and took two years to complete. It is scored for a late classical orchestra, nearly resembling a romantic period orchestra (2 flutes (1st doubling on piccolo in one aria), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons and contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 1 alto trombone, 1 tenor trombone and 1 bass trombone, timpani, percussion, and strings). Subsequent performances often expanded this instrumentation, with many including a pianoforte part. Though less popular than the Creation, the work was still a widespread success, with many praising it as one of the greatest accomplishments of the century (ugh, sorry not sorry). I didn’t listen to the whole thing (largely due to the fact that it is over two hours long), but I didn’t mind it too much I suppose. It definitely sounded much more akin to mid or late period Beethoven, something like his 4th to 9th symphonies. Still has a lot of Classical flair in terms of harmony and orchestration, but a little bit more adventurous than a straight early classical symphony. I also hear him quote his Surprise Symphony in one movement. I’ve grown super cynical of classical music, but it’s not like I’m adverse to it. It’s nice for what it is, but I definitely prefer stuff with a bit more edge.",
"I haven’t been updating my logs like I should be, so I am going back through and doing a quick entry for all the albums I have listened to. The british group originally started as a doom metal band named Pagan Angel. They have gone through many lineup and style changes since, more recently turning to a progressive rock sound. They formed in 1990 and are still active. This album, released in 2012, is their ninth. It leans into a more progressive pop/ post- progressive sound. From what I remember about my listening, this seems to be pretty true. It has a lot of acoustic elements, pretty simple harmonies, and lighter vocals that have a more early 2000’s pop sound to them. That said, I did enjoy the album quite a bit. It was very easy to listen to.",
"I don’t remember why I listened to this album exactly, but I think it is because it was the genesis of his hit tune Rocket Man. This is John’s fifth studio album, released in 1972, and it represents his continued movement towards a more rock and roll sound. I don’t remember having anything particular to say about the album other than that it is just solid all the way around. It has a very Elton John sound, in terms of the piano writing and especially how he sets his lyrics. He loves agogic stress on offbeats for emotional emphasis (things like Oooo). I do remember liking the tune I Think I’m Going to Kill Myself quite a bit. Sort of in a similar vein to Today by the Smashing Pumpkins, but it leans into the lighthearted juxtaposition suicide much more heavily. Probably because it is a tongue and cheek nod at melodramatic teenagers.",
"I think Alan Theisen might have suggested this one, but I can’t quite remember. I have heard the orchestral arrangement of Starburst once before, but aside from that, I am not familiar with Jessie’s work. She is a violinist who grew up in Manhattan during the 80’s. That area was a hotbed for artistic activity at the time, and her parent’s explicit decision to expose her to all things art and advocacy had a huge influence on her style. According to her website, Her music interweaves classical music with elements of vernacular music, improvisation, language, and social justice, placing her squarely as one of the most relevant interpreters of 21st-century American sound and experience. This is her debut album, and I enjoyed it immensely. It struck me as leaning heavily on gestures in addition to traditional melodic elements. The second track, Source Code, was a favorite. It sounded to my ears like an homage to African American styles, and her program note confirms this: This one-movement work is a kind of dirge, which centers on a melody based on syntax derived from black spirituals. I imagine that the title refers to how vastly transformed those styles became in America. A really beautiful work and album. I am always impressed by composers who can make a string quartet sound like fifty instruments instead of four. I think she more than accomplished this. I definitely need to keep my eyes open for more of her stuff.",
"I’ve been looking forward to John Mitchell’s newest album from Lonely Robot. It didn’t disappoint. He has such a characteristic sound, in terms of how he layers instrumentation and also in terms of his vocals. I do find that it can be a little tiring at times, but for the most part, he changes things up enough to maintain my interest. I particularly liked the track Crystalline, which seems to be about a breakup. It is also worth mentioning that I saw a video where he did a mix breakdown of Spiders in Cubase, and I understood basically everything he was talking about. It was a really cool feeling that gave me a lot of hope and confidence in my current direction.",
"Derek recommended this album to me ages ago, and I finally got around to listening to it. He is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Compton, California. He was born in 1998, so only two years older than me. Pretty crazy. He began making music in high school using the iRig app on his iPhone. He somehow got pretty heavy into production, working with artists such as  Twenty88, Denzel Curry, Isaiah Rashad, J. Cole, GoldLink, and Kendrick Lamar (producing the song Pride on his Pulitzer Prize and Grammy Award winning album Damn). His genres are listed as Alternative R&B, neo soul, funk, jazz, indie rock, and lo-fi. This is his first EP as a solo artist, and was also produced almost exclusively on his iPhone (he did write the drum loops in Ableton). Lacy describes it as a song series, and it is listed as Neo Soul, Funk, Indie Rock, and Lo- Fi. I really like this work, especially given the circumstances of it’s production. It grooves really hard, but in a laid back sort of way. I can’t really make any parallels to other works, but I suspect that might be partially because I am not terribly familiar with the style. I should dive more into funk and soul, especially because I’ve only really listened to Knower and Louis Cole (who are almost entirely white).",
"Speaking of Knower. They are an American independent electronic music duo consisting of  Louis Cole and Genevieve Artadi. Their full band is a jazz funk act including bass, drums, vocals, synth, and sax. They both studied jazz in California, and met through mutual friends such as Jack Conte (a musician friend of Cole’s who also happens to be the CEO of Patreon). They began releasing music on YouTube, and after experiencing success through promotion, began moving to other platforms. The bands lineup frequently shifts around the core duo, often enlisting the helps of people like Jacob Mann and Sam Gendel (who is suspected of being behind Clown Core with Louis). Interestingly enough, the group opened for the Red Hot Chili Peppers a few times in 2017. This album was released in 2013. I really enjoyed it. Their style is so distinct, especially in terms of lyrical content. They are just a super tight group of musicians making some really fun and awesome stuff.",
"So I searched my master log, and apparently I haven’t listened to any Rach before. I am very familiar with his poem Isle of the Dead and probably cold recognize a few of his piano works, but aside from that, I suppose I don’t know much about him. He was a Russian composer, pianist, and conductor of the mid 1800’s to the mid 1900’s (largely Late Romantic Period). He studied at the Moscow Conservatory alongside pupil Alexander Scriabin and teacher Rimsky Korsakov. His Symphony Number 1 was lambasted by critics, and he entered a deep depression where he didn’t compose for many months. His Symphony Number 2 was well received, and at this point he returned to composing. He moved with his family to Dresden in the early 1900’s to avoid the political unrest in Russia. Soon after the October Revolution, he emigrated to the United States as a Conductor and Pianist (in order to help supplement his composition career). They spent some time living in NYC, but moved to California later to support his health. He died in 1943. His compositional style is heavily influenced by Tchaikovsky, with piano features and highly colorful orchestrations. He is also known for singing melodicism, bell like textures, and inter-tonal chromaticism and counterpoint. This work was composed in 1909, just after his move to NYC. It was premiered there with Rach at the keys. The second performance had Mahler at the podium, an experience which Rach would never forget. It is a work in three movements, and it considered by many to be one of the most difficult piano pieces in the repertoire. It is scored for winds in 2’s, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, three trombones, tuba, percussion, and strings. My conclusion: Rach 3 is good! It wasn’t my favorite thing in the world, but it definitely had some pretty great moments. There were a lot of textural swells that I enjoyed quite a bit, and the last ten minutes or so is quite the ride. The melodicism reminded me a lot of stuff by Kalinnikov and Korsakov, but the orchestration gave me hints of French influence for some reason. Maybe I’m just not well versed in Russian orchestral literature enough. I might have a different opinion if I went back and listened to Korsakov. Overall pretty good though. I’d like to listen again sometime, just because I feel like the form didn’t stick in my ear. My mind tends to wander during long listenings, and I lose track of all the themes and sections. Something I really have to work on.",
"Another album recommendation from John. They are an English heavy metal band that formed in 1975. They were part of the new wave of British heavy metal band, experiencing widespread success in the early 80’s. Despite controversy in the states early on (re. Satanism), they are considered by many to be one of the most influential metal bands of all time. The tote sixteen studio albums and twelve live albums, with Number of the Beast being their most successful. This album, released in 1988, is their seventh studio album. It is a progressive metal concept album about the book of the same name by Orson Scott Card. In it, a lad named Alvin (the seventh son of a seventh son), is endowed with mystical abilities akin to that of a Maker (the second of all time, with the first being Jesus). The Unmaker recognizes his abilities, and tries to destroy him from a young age. Overall I enjoyed the album quite a bit. It wasn’t nearly as heavy as I was expecting, although this is before the time when really production heavy albums were being produced. It has an almost dry sort of sound that is akin to mid period Genesis. This observation might be driven largely by the use of keyboards throughout, which is supposedly not something they do a ton. The lead vocalist has an interesting timbre to his voice, much more defined than something I normally expect from metal. It sounds a lot like the vocalist from Spock’s Beard. Overall a cool album that I would definitely listen to again. It also has a super cool album cover (their mascot Eddie floating over ice).",
"I can’t remember where I saw this album, but I listened to it. I couldn’t find a ton of info on them, other than it’s a guy named Patrick Fiore that writes ambient pop type stuff. That said, I really enjoyed this album. The electronic albums are really clean, and his tenor voice adds a shit ton of personality to it. I honestly haven’t heard anything quite like it, and it sounds like what I imagine a collaboration between me and Dylan would sound like. Super cool stuff, def gonna keep an eye out for him.",
"Andy Hudson posted about this on Insta, because the ensemble he is in (Latitude 49) played a few of the tunes. Reinaldo is a Venzuelan- American composer. He has two degrees in composition from Julliard, and is a founding member of the Simon Bolivar orchestra. This is his debut album, and it features performances by Latitude 49 and the Attacca Quartet, as well as soloist Francesca Anderegg. Overall I enjoyed this album quite a bit. I definitely heard some minimalist influences, and I noticed that he really enjoys making use of repeated flourishing gestures. Very meditative and nice to listen to.",
"Ok I finally decided to dive into the Taylor craze a little bit. Obviously I’ve heard of her, but I am not at all familiar with her work. She announced this album release two days ago, so I thought I’d give it a listen. She was born in 1989 in Pennsylvania, but she quickly relocated to Nashville to pursue a musical career. She was the youngest artist signed to Sony publishing house (age 14), and she signed her first record deal at age 15. Since then, she has been immensely popular and successful (it’s clear that she has an absurd amount of talent). Her music, which began as pop country, largely focuses on personal events and issues. She is currently one of the worlds best selling music artists, with her personal life under constant scrutiny. She is often credited with helping to popularize country music. This album was recorded entirely during the Covid-19 Pandemic. It is an indie folk, alternative rock, electro-folk and chamber pop album driven by pianos and guitars, with a heavy emphasis on fictional storytelling. This aspects are immediately noticeable during listening, as it is laid back and really thoughtful. This represents her departure from the more pop and country releases of earlier times (although, as with anything, there are plenty of exceptions to this statement). The album also features a collaboration with Bon Iver (who I definitely need to check out). Overall I enjoyed this album a lot. It is definitely not what I was expecting when I hit play, and I will definitely be listening to it again sometime very soon.",
"Tool’s first album (released in 1993) which I have been meaning to listen to for some time now. The album was just fantastic. Very anti- religion and nihilistic, but almost wistful in that handling (those words taken from AllMusic). They also claim that the album helped keep metal in a mainstream place. The final tune, Disgustipated, features three pianos being destroyed with shotguns and sledgehammers. Many bands claim to see bullet holes in the studio where recording happened (Sound City Studios in LA). The liner artwork features of a nude obese woman, a nude thin man, and the band members with pins in the sides of their heads. This caused the album to be removed from many stores. As a response, Tool released a modified version with just a barcode. They said that fans could mail in this version to receive the original in the mail at no extra cost. The album is really really good. Lateralus was great, but I think I prefer this one. The last track in particular was outstanding. It’s sort of a riff on Scientology, which the band actively spoke out against. Apparently the founder figured out that vegetables could feel pain, and continued to hear their screams from that point on. The sermon at the beginning, while satirical, is haunting. The end of the track also features a message apparently left for the lead singer by his landlord. It implies murder, and many analyze the track as a logica descent into evil (if we kill vegetables, then why not people? It is necessary, life feeds on life). Crazy stuff.",
"Another album by Gazpacho, this one released in 2007. They claim it as their first concept album, which is essentially about the boundary between dreams and reality. Overall I liked it, but I honestly didn’t find it to be super memorable. To be fair, I was doing other stuff while listening, and there were certainly moments I enjoyed quite a bit, but it felt like it dragged on a little bit at times. That does tend to be a stylistic tendency I notice in their music. Lyrics tend to be straight forward, but they occupy a large amount of temporal space (aka, they sing lyrics on very long note values. Hearing eighth notes in the lyrics is rare). It gives the album a very contemplative quality thats unique in its own right, but if you aren’t prepared for that, then it definitely won’t be super satisfying. That said, there are a lot of tunes from Molok that I still listen to regularly. I think the same could be true for this album. I’m sure that if I listened to it again, I would find some other stuff that I really like in it.",
"After confirming with my master log, I have never listened to Boulez. And reading over his bio, I realize how much I need to refresh on my contemporary classical musics! He was French, born in 25’, died in 2016, and was one of the most influential composers of post- war classical music. He studied at the Paris Conservatory under Messiaen, and privately with Rene Leibowitz (the schoenberg fanboy and general supporter of the Second Viennese School). He became a well known avant- garde composer in the 1950’s, quickly leading the charge with integrated serialism and controlled chase music. From the 70’s on, he was heavily involved with the realtime electronic manipulation of instrumental music. He revised a lot, and as such has a relatively small body of completed works. He was known for being somewhat dogmatic in his commitment to modernism. He was also an accomplished conductor known for his performance of works from the early twentieth century (Debussy, Stravinsky, Ravel, Bartok), as well as his contemporaries (Ligeti, Berio, Elliot Carter). He had this weird habit where he would be friends with people for a long time, but then break off contact when he didn’t disagree with them musically (Cage is the perfect example). In addition to his conducting and composing career, he also founded the The Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique / Musique (IRCAM) in France, much like Berio founding the Studio di fonologia musicale in Milan, or the swedish Elektronmusikstudion. This piece was written in 1965 after two poems by René Char. It translates as Sun of waters, and it is a cantata for Soprano, Orchestra, and Choir. That piece was wild. You can definitely tell it’s serialist, but the textures are absolutely all over the place. I’m almost thinking this could be integrated. In any case, there were times that it sounded like Pierre Lunaire on crack, but less free atonality and more fixed in place. I think the strongest point of this piece for me, though, was its growth. The first seven stanzas place the soloist and orchestra in antiphony, and then the last eleven section bring in the full instrumental forces. None of it felt forced or rushed, lending the piece to a very smooth and exciting build to climax (which, I might add, wasn’t a clear point (at least for me), but rather a wash of activity). Pretty cool, although I doubt me and Boulez would have gotten along.",
"So I’ve heard of this fellow before, but never really listened to his stuff. He was a French composer active from the late 1800’s to the mid 1900’s. He was a political radical all his life, and quite eccentric (often drawing musical inspiration from nature, film, serialism, astrology, medieval music, books, and JS Bach. He had an incredibly prolific output which was greatly varied in style and form. He studied at the Paris Conservatory under Faure, who had an immense influence on him. He did a few teaching stints in the US, but largely remained in France. He was fond of the symphonic poem form, and after WWI when neoclassicism and small ensembles were vogue, many of his works went unperformed and unpublished. He was closely interested in the works of Schoenberg outside of his impressionistic and bachian studies. I also found it interesting that he wrote a Seven Stars Symphony, with each movement based on a different actor. He was not terribly successful, but he was venerated in the French music scene nonetheless. This piece is part of a cycle based on The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. It was composed between 1899 and 1936, thus representing a huge swath of his life. One article considered it the stepping stone between Debussy and Messaien and Boulez. I can definitely hear that analogy. There are times where the piece is somewhat impressionistic in harmony, timbre, and melody (especially the opening), but those moments quickly devolve into a quasi- satirical take on Modernism (which might not be satirical after all. He is talking about monkeys). This piece is absolutely mad from an orchestrational standpoint. The seamless change of colors and astounding dovetailing of lines is just incredible. I particularly liked his combination of contrabassoon with high range tuba. A really beautiful color. He also has a short little fugal passage that was super hot. Definitely a reflection of his infatuation with the music of Bach and baroque period counterpoint. Also worth mentioning that the initial statements of the subject are in the extreme high registers of Contra Bassoon, Tuba, Contrabass, and Viola. Largely bass voices with a strained, airy sort of sound. High key think this is one of my new favorite orchestral pieces ever. It’s just so freakin cool.",
"Greetings! Welcome to my first listening log entry for Choral Arranging Class! Now I should mention that, since I have my own listening logs, I am just documenting my listening there and then transferring it over to what I hand in. If you do not like the submitted format, I can slim things down before submission. Let me know. Now, back to how I would normally format my entries. Moses Hogan (1957- 2003) was an American composer and arranger of choral music, best known for his arrangements of spirituals. He is often credited as single- handedly introducing spirituals into the standard choral repertoire. He grew up in New Orleans, where he excelled quickly in music. He was awarded a full scholarship to the Oberlin Conservatory, and he briefly pursued graduate studies at Julliard. He began arranging in 1980, and in 1994 he published his first arrangement, Elijah Rock. He formed a group, The Moses Hogan Singers, which released their first album in 2002. He died a year later from a brain tumor at the age of 45. I really enjoyed Elijah Rock. I notice there were a lot of droning, ostinato patterns with another independent idea layered on tOpus  My ears tended to focus on the upper part, but the lower parts presence still gave it a really high degree of momentum. I think I would describe this texture as more polyphonic, giving the moments of monophony and homophony a lot more impact. I definitely enjoyed the US Air Force Singers more than the BYU singers, largely because the recording had much less reverb. I found this let things speak a little bit more, especially when there was some polyphonic stuff going on. Wade in the Water was quite different from Elijah Rock as it relates to the texture. It was largely homophonic, with a soloist taking the solo part. This was a really beautiful and refreshing sound, although there were times where I got a little bored of hearing the same thing over and over. There really wasn’t much of a change until the very end of the piece. Overall it was effective, but I would have liked to hear a little bit more variation. That said, Moses Hogan has left a very positive impression. I do not listen to a lot of choral music, and I admittedly have never really enjoyed it all that much. This is definitely something I could see myself listening to casually, though, and I am excited to see what other music this class will expose me to and through which lenses.",
"Another class which requires listening! I told Dr. Smith yesterday that, since I have my own private listening logs, I will just be copying whatever I do there into the assignment drOpus  If you are not happy with the form, I can trim things down a bit. Just let me know! Now, back to your regularly scheduled programming. Scott McAllister (1969) is an American Composer and clarinetist from Vero Beach, Florida. He received his PhD from Rice university and currently teaches at Baylor University in Waco Texas. He is known for his pieces featuring clarinet, namely Black Dog (influenced heavily by the music of Led Zepellin) and Concerto X. The latter is a work in three movements heavily inspired by the 80’s grunge music of Nirvana and Alice in Chains. Thus, it represents themes of confinement and a desire for freedom. Right away, there are things I am very interested to see notated. Particularly, I notice the opening of the first movement features a lot of timbre trills in the solo part. In addition, I am also expecting to see some feathered beaming. I also heard a couple of glissandos, which could be interesting to see. On a more macroscopic scale, though, I am interested to see the so called Philosophy of Notation that we discussed today. I suspect that the score will be more traditional in format (instructions for sound), but I could easily see it being more along the instructions for execution paradigm, especially during instances of those advanced techniques mentioned above. I loved the second movement. There were moments where it almost sounded like a pierrot ensemble. The piano writing was super cool, with the high melodic parts being juxtaposed by instances of low end bass writing. I think I heard mention that this was a Passacaglia as well, which is super cool. I always find those subtle, continuous forms of development to be really fitting in contemporary works. The third movement had so much driving energy. I loved how the high end clarient did a call and response with high end violins, the sounds becoming nearly indistinguishable. Overall a wicked cool piece. Sampson recommendations never cease to amaze. Now, time for the score. First impressions are equal parts surprised and not surprised. The notation is definitely more instructions for sound based. I wish I could see the timbre trill notation in the reduction, but it’s only in the solo part. I suppose it would be extraneous to have it in the reduction, and I think the numbered trill indications say enough. No feathered beaming, just a written indication to begin the trill slowly and speed up. Other than that, the score seems to be about what I expected. I am interested to discuss it, though, because I can’t tell if I am just used to looking at score like this, or maybe someone else has a completely different take on the whole thing.",
"There is very little information on this guy. All I know is that he lived from 1933 to 2002, he studied with Ligeti, and he was a Swedish composer who had immense influence on the contemporary music scene there. This piece was composed in 1969. Listening to it again, I am just completely covered in chills. The incredible range of timbres produced by this piece of music is astounding, and incredibly haunting. This unfamiliarity is only bolstered by the foreign language of the text. Despite the various textures present, it reminded me overwhelmingly of Ligeti’s Requiem. Those micro polyphonic, sound mass textures are just so effective. I definitely need to ask Dr. Smith about this guy, because I would love to listen to more of his stuff.",
"Graham recommended me this piece. Lukas Foss (1922- 2009) was a German American composer and conductor. He was born in Germany and quickly recognized as a child prodigy. His family moved to America in 1937, where he studied at the Curtis Institute of Music. He was good friends with classmate Leonard Bernstein (who described him as an authentic genius), and he conducted the premiere of his Symphonic Dances from West Side Story. He briefly studied composition under Paul Hindemith, and replaced Arnold Schoenberg’s post at UCLA. His wife Cornelia was briefly a lover of Glenn Gould (not important, just interesting. They separated for a few years, and she hooked up with him). He passed away from Parkinson’s Disease. This piece was composed in 1944. This piece just slaps soooooo hard. The energy it manages to build throughout is simply astonishing, and I’m not completely sure how it is done. I know a piece of it is metrical, where he will have phrase fragments being forced to overlap because of the meter (ex. A four beat phrase is put into 3/4, and that last overhanging beat becomes the beginning of the next 4 beat phrase). I think another piece is static harmony with motivic variations that slowly undergo these sorts of metrical shifts. I notice that the piano will pick up little melodic fragments as the flute does this, filling things out quite a bit. Also can’t get over the multiphonics in the third movement. So unexpected, yet so perfect as well. Overall, just an absolutely incredible piece of music.",
"I’m realizing just how much music I have listened to without logging it. I think there is sometimes a lot of stress with this log, since it really just takes a ton of time to research and articulate my feelings about a work. So, I’ve decided that even if I jut enter in the piece and what I thought, that will be good enough. Stuff is busy and scary right now, so I can’t blame myself if the logs falter a little. I’ll do my best to be thorough and articulate, but sometimes it will be what it will be. That said, Voyeur Motel released their EP today, and its pretty great. Graham, Matt, Gabe, and the guitarist just did such a great job. The whole thing has this soft sort of grunge sound that sounds like a mix between Radiohead and the Replacements. Good stuff. I’m proud of them, and it has been a pleasure to hear it develop over the last year or so.",
"These fellas also released their debut EP today, and I gotta say, I’m super impressed. I knew they existed through sound services (Ellen Li and Patrick O’Brocta, and Jonathan Zareski), but I didn’t realize how good the stuff they were putting together is. The lyrics are super strong, the playing is great, and the production is exceptional. The whole album has a super laid back sound that I fuck super hard with. Great stuff, can’t wait to see what they do in the coming years.",
"More Corigliano (this time for Notation class)! I listened to his first symphony a while back (the one about the friends he lost during the AIDS pandemic), and I remember it being a very affecting piece. I also watched the Red Violin recently, and I somehow forgot that he wrote the score for that as well. This piece was written in 1986 and premiered by the New York Phil. It was originally conceived as a solo piano work for the Van Cliburn competition, and he later orchestrated it. The piece draws inspiration from the heavy, minimalistic ostinato in the second movement of Beethoven’s 7th symphony. Corigliano states that the minimalistic nature of it was very attractive, but he wanted to combine it with a much more defined form. Thus, the piece is divided into a binary much like the Beethoven. The program note also mentions an interest in leaving durations up to the performer for the piano version, but when it was fully orchestrated, everything was notate in detail. I am excited to see how that translates aurally and notationally. Overall I really liked this piece. The development of the rhythmic and harmonic ideas associated with the second movement of Beef Boy’s 7th were really cool, and I especially enjoyed the entrance of the full theme at the 13ish minute mark (and then again just past 15 minutes, that time the harmonic rather than rhythmic (thus paralleling the development over the binary two part structure- rhythmic, and then harmonic)). It reminds me of the 12th variation in Rzewski’s El Pueblo Unidos. The thing is lurking there the whole time, and when it finally appears fully, it just hits you. Notationally, I am super excited to see how he accomplished the transition into that 13 minute mark. I want to do something similar in my art song, and I have been wracking my head over how to accomplish it. Now, time for the score. I was pleasantly surprised to see that Professor Sampson gave us the piano score to look it, and I must say that I liked the piece significantly more after reading along. The piece was a really interesting mix between metered and unmetered sections, with unmetered sections tening towards a more sparse orchestration, and the metered towards a more full orchestration. The reasons for this should be pretty obvious. In terms of the unmetered sections- I noticed two primary notational things. He would have a rhythmic pattern (ie. a single beam group) being broken into little chunks by repeats. This tactic seems like a really simple and effective way to extend a rhythm through repeated fragments. The other thing I saw, which might be more applicable to my art song, is an entire pattern boxed in with an arrow afterwards. This seems to indicate that the whole idea is repeated ad lib. until another change in the score. Super cool stuff. I noticed that he put a lot of the performance notes in the score, allowing the performer to reference them on the go without flipping back to the pre- music materials. The ninth page even had an ossia clarifying the reference to Beethoven 7 (although it is not actually an ossia, it looks a lot like one). On that same page, he also used dotted lines to help certain unmetered fragments align with other unmetered fragments. Overall a super cool work with a lot of notational goodies. Definitely something I will reference in the future when I need to write some unmetered stuff.",
"My focus was on Hayburner this last week, but I wanted to do a little blurb about the album, since I did listen to the whole thing. Basie (1904- 1984) was an American jazz pianist, organist, bandleader, and composer. In 1935 he founded the Count Basie Orchestra, which he led for almost 50 years. They rose to great prominence in the big band scene, leading many innovations such as emphasis on the rhythm section and using arrangers to broaden the ensembles sound. This album was released in 1968, and it represents his first collaboration with Sammy Nestico (who became a long time orchestrator for the ensemble). Overall just a great album, and I had a blast studying Hayburner.",
"I am pretty excited that our listening assignment for this week is good ol’ Arne. We listened to his piece Aglepta a few weeks ago (which I logged above), and I absolutely loved it. So, I have high expectations for this work. Like before, there is little information on this work. The text is in Latin, and it is the famous quote by Cicero which translates as No-one dances sober, unless he is insane. A very interesting quote, which I can see being taken many directions. Just given what I know about Arne, I almost suspect he will be using this text as a means to depict such an insane individual. Maybe he might also choose to set it in the style of a dance, something in a compound or simple triple meter. After listening, I can say that I was partially correct. There were certainly instances of dance- like rhythms, but I don’t think it was ever purely in a compound meter. I ended up watching a live performance (because I was so curious), and it seemed to be in 4 for the most part. That said, this piece was very cool. Similar to Aglepta, Arne managed to create some timbres which I never would have imagined in the choral setting. Noises I used to make as a little kid made an appearance, and in the full force of the ensemble, it had a really haunting sound. There were a few times where I swore I was listening to Con Legno strings, but that turned out to not be the case. The way I perceived the piece just listening to the audio and watching a live performance was vastly different, as the live part was largely performative. There were instances of different sections dancing, or talking amongst each other like a crowd (something which I really liked). Without speaking Latin, the whole thing felt like slightly agitated gossip at a dance social, much like what I expected from the text. I would love to see the score for this sometime, because there are definitely things I want to steal. I really need to listen to more of his stuff. He is turning me into a choir geek! Cool stuff, and I would love to give writing something like this a shot someday.",
"These logs have become pretty exhausting to do, especially with this semesters work load and lack of motivation. I want to keep them going, though, so I might really just do an entry with one or two sentences. Just so I can say that I listened to something, and maybe come back to fill out details later. Who knows. So I listened to this album, cause I am studying the tune Kids are Pretty People for comp lessons. I liked it a lot, much more seemingly free form and spontaneous than the Baise album. Good Shit.",
"I listened to this a bit because Bucket plays horn on a couple of tunes. Pretty neat, with a more domestic Radiohead sort of sound. Fans don’t seem to like it that much, reminding me of the Smashing Pumpkins latest couple singles. Some people really don’t like change. I hope I can keep an open mind throughout my whole life. Good album.",
"Speaking of which. Two tunes on this little EP-esque release. I liked them a lot, but diehard fans seemed to think otherwise. Definitely not their characteristic hard edge, but it still screams Billy Corgan. More reminiscent of their electronica tunes, like Love or Eyes. Graham didnt like the digital clipping throughout, but I don’t care too much. It def has a vibe, even if it doesn’t perfectly fit the tune. I might try it in something of my own sometimes, a little analog saturation in the Mids or something like that",
"My GOD what a fun tune to listen to! Studying it for lessons, and I just wanted to say that its amazing. The form is wicked, but it totally works. Its unexpected and witty and just all around amazing. If I could write something on par with this someday, I would be very happy.",
"We listened to a bit of this in Notation, and I immediately wanted to check it out. Gorecki (1933- 2010) was Polish composer of contemporary music. He was a leading figure of the Polish avant-garde during the post-Stalin cultural thaw. He was a Weberian Serialist, tending towards repetition of simple melodic and rhythmic ideas. He became the founder of the so called New Polish School, an array of Polish composers under similar influences (including  Witold Lutosławski and Krzysztof Penderecki). This piece, composed in 1976, is his most famous piece. It was rerecorded to commemorate the victims of the Holocaust in 1992, which exploded in popularity and secured his fame worldwide. It represents his shift away from modernism and into neo- modality. It is in three movements for orchestra and solo sopraNumber The first movement text is a Polish lament of the Virgin Mary, the second a message found written on the wall of a Gestapo Cell, And the third a Silesian folk song of a mother searching for her son killed by the Germans in the Silesian uprisings. The first and third movements are from the perspective of mothers missing their children, the second from the perspective of a lost child. The second movement text translates as Oh Mamma do not cry, Number Immaculate Queen of Heaven, you support me always. The first is O my son, beloved and chosen, Share your wounds with your mother. I don’t think I’ve cried this hard at a piece in a long while. It really just struck a chord with me, as it has with so many. The first movement starts out as a low melodic rumble in the basses, slowly introducing the figure canonical in other voices. According to various analysis, each entry appears in a different mode, creating this intense, building wash of sound. This continues for half of the movement, before a single piano note signals the entrance of the divine soprano solo. The canon then goes essentially in reverse, ending the movement with double basses (arch form). This piece is sooooooo reminiscent of the main theme to Shawshank Redemption by Thomas Newman. The Growth is nearly identical, and the overall timbre and harmonic characteristics are similar as well. The film was released only two years after the symphony’s massive success, so I’m almost betting that Newman is referencing it explicitly. Certainly, the themes are similar. The innocent being trapped at the hands of some injustice, longing for family and freedom. God is it beautiful. The second movement is beautiful as well. The soprano takes a more prominent role, seeming to almost fit into the orchestra like a unified piece of it. In some weird sense, it reminds me of Mana by Fagerlund in that regard. The sense of connectedness and movement is astounding. The third movement was more analogous to the second in terms of overall character. The second two movements didn’t hit me as hard as the first, but the first also took damn near everything I have. What an amazing piece of music. I can totally understand why it became so immensely popular.",
"Their new album. Very Gazpacho. Like, verrrrrry gazpacho. I dig it, but a lot of their stuff can begin to sound exactly the same. That’s sort of their thing though, so I really can’t criticize too much. There was some wicked cool binaural audio in the last track, where it sounds like someone is talking directly into your right ear. It caught me off guard and definitely freaked me out a little bit.",
"My god. John told me to listen to this. I’ve heard it before, but not in a long time. And it is so freaking good. I cannot believe it is 43 years old (released in 77’). It sounds so unbelievably clean for the technology they had at the time. This combined with the tight players just lends itself to an album that sounds like it could have come out of the 90’s or 00’s. Like, it sounds that good. Such an easy thing to listen to, combining elements of jazz and funk with pOpus  It won a bunch of awards for its production, which is not surprising. Apparently it qualifies as Yacht Rock, which was a broadly successful style of soft rock that came out of the lat 70’s and early 80’s. The title track features Wayne Shorter on sax. It is Steely Dan’s sixth studio album, and was recorded alongside 40 musicians. The band is led by Donald Fagen and Walter Becker. Good stuff.",
"Soooooo this kinda blew my mind, so I want to do a quick entry on it. Britten (1930-76) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist. He is a central figure of music in the 21st century, and he is best known for his vocal works. His output includes a variety of compositions, the most famous of which are operas, and he also spent a fair amount of time conducting and performing. This piece is part of a collection of songs called Friday Afternoons, composed in 1935. They are mostly unison settings of texts by Walter de la Mer, but this tune is in canon. It was also featured in the film Moonrise Kingdom. I loved this piece. The droning piano part at the outset helps to solidify the starting pitches, and then things slowly grow from that. It goes into two-voice canon, and then I think maybe three voices, meanwhile the underlying piano part becomes very harmonically adventurous. The piece reaches a climax with a mensuration canon, as one of the voices augments by a factor of two. This feels almost like when a tune will go into half-time at the chorus. That initial momentum is subconsciously perceived under the new metric pulse, lending itself to an increased energy level through decreasing the energy. Really incredible. The fact that this was done by a children’s choir is astounding, and I can’t even imagine what he has done with more mature groups. I’ve listened to his arrangement of the Ash Grove, but I don’t think I’ve really heard anything outside of that. I will definitely have to do a deeper dive at some point.",
"Time for another choral arranging entry! I’ve heard of Libby Larsen, but I’ve never actually listened to any of her music. She is an American composer of contemporary classical music. She earned her PhD at the University of Minnesota, and she co-founded the American Composers Forum with a colleague there. She was appointed a residency with the Minnesota Orchestra in 1983, making her the first woman to do so. She has won a plethora of scores, and has written works for many different ensembles. This piece, composed in 2000, is a four movement song cycle for six part male choir commissioned by the King’s Singers for valentine’s Day 2001. It uses texts by William Shakespeare and James Joyce, following the story of lover through various stages of their relationship. The first movement immediately reminds me of early church chants, which makes sense given her extensive training in Gregorian Chant at a young age. The first movement featured moments of polyphony juxtaposed with dissonant homorhythmic chords, as well as heterophonic textures. Most of the other movements followed suit, changing the texture frequently to maintain interest level. This reminds me a lot of the things we discussed in orchestration, specifically using textural changes to signify sectional changes. Something about the striking dissonant chords gets me. They certainly sound good in instrumental contests, but hearing them in a purely vocal sense is supremely satisfying. Maybe this is because I don’t listen to a ton of choral music, but in any case, it is worth mentioning. The transition between the second and third movements was really really cool.The texture change pretty drastically, but the text sort of tied it together in a really interesting way (Will you be my Valentine? vs. I will marry you!). Overall, a great piece of music. I think the all male (old style pronoun descriptor used for lack of a more suitable substitute) choir has a really unique sort of timbre, as does an all female or even all children’s choir.",
"Apparently Phil Collins’s son is also a musician with a fair number of prog rock albums out. This is his latest, and I really dug it. It had the lyrical qualities of folks like Gazpacho and RWPL, but the music leaned more heavily into found sound and noise. Definitely gotta keep my eyes on him.",
"Another album from the massively rebranded George Miller (AKA Filthy Frank, Pink Guy, Joji Vlogs). Can’t say I totally know what I am listening for in an album like this, but things definitely sounded very well thought out and cohesive.",
"I’m preparing for my arranging project, and Deemer gave me a bunch of albums to check out. We’ve spent a lot of time analyzing more traditional scores in the Inside the Score by Rayburn Wright, so he wanted me to listen to some more progressive contemporary examples. Maria is an American jazz orchestra leader and composer. She received music degrees from the university of Minnesota, Eastman and the University of Miami before being hired by Gil Evans as his copyist and assistant. Together they helped Sting with a film score (The Color of Money), which helped secure her position as one of the most acclaimed composers and bandleaders of her generation. She also studied with Bob Brookmeyer (what a small world). She is a huge advocate for musician rights, having actively spoken out against freemium models of music streaming at the United States Copyright Office. She has one multiple Grammy’s. This is her latest album, released in 2020, and it comprises a collection of her most popular works. Overall, I have to say what a frickin bop this album is. I feel as though i can hear a Brookmeyer influence in a lot of the tunes, especially Choro Dancado (which also exhibits hints of Light as a Feather, particularly with the vocals). The arranging sounds familiar, yet new and exciting in this tune. The first tracks on the album, in slight contrast, feel much more loose and non traditionally orchestrated. I really love the sound of that, and its definitely something I would consider emulating. I couldn’t name really specific things, but something about the arranging feels much less blocky (sort of like what we discussed in my lesson yesterday). It isn’t four musical sections, but rather a collection of unique colors which she is drawing from. The formal structure of the pieces still feels fairly defined, but the color from section to section is maybe more diverse. It’s honestly quite difficult to articulate a lot of these things without a score, which I guess is a weakness on my end. Maybe this project will help me improve with that, especially given the tune and style I am sort of aiming for. In any case, this album is totally stacked. I dig it super super hard.",
"I haven’t been this ticked off in a while. One half of my family is just… yeah. Glad Dr. Smith shared this today, because it gives me hope.",
"More listening for my big band arranging project. Evans was a Canadian-American jazz pianist, arranger, composer and bandleader. He is credited with aiding the development of cool jazz, modal jazz, free jazz, and jazz fusion. He collaborated frequently with Miles Davis, producing albums such as Miles Ahead (1957), Porgy and Bess (1958), and Sketches of Spain (1960). Apparently he also recorded an album with Astrud Gilberto (Look to the Rainbow, which I definitely check out at some point). This album was released in 1960, and it was one of Impulse! Records first major releases. The thing I immediately notice about Evans’s style is his use of what I might call auxiliary sounds. In addition to doublings such as flute, tuba, and french horn, much of the writing I might describe as falling outside of traditional big band orchestration. For example, in the first track, I notice a muted trumpet playing little flourishes behind a saxophone solo. I don’t want to say this isn’t something that would have been done before (since broad brush strokes can be dangerous), but to my ears, this sounds like it breaks the mold a bit. Pads and hits don’t have traditional orchestrations, but rather focus on the timbre possibilities within the group. In that sense, it comes across as almost classical in nature at times. It’s honestly pretty difficult to articulate just why this sort of writing is so unique from older forms, but I think that’s the best I can do. The varied orchestration, instrumentation, form, and harmonic language whilst maintaining a core sense of ensemble and style lends itself to a very unique sound. Overall an absolutely awesome album. It’s no surprise that Deemer suggested some Stravinsky and Torke listening to go along with it. I see them as being nearly parallel in style.",
"More listening for this big band project. I love this movie, so I was thrilled when Deemer suggested I listen to the OST. Now, Harry Connick Jr. is a name that I have heard before, but am not terribly familiar with. He is an American singer, pianist, composer, actor, and television host. He has made many appearances on the big screen and television, particularly on American Idol and in the film Independence Day as a fighter pilot. He studied at MSM and released quite a few albums before his growing reputation landed him the Harry Met Sally gig in the late 80’s. In fact, it was the drummer from Blood Sweat and Tears that dropped his name. The film includes original music as well as a few standards, with performances by Harry and some other profile names such as Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, and Bing Crosby. The orchestrations were done by Mark Shaiman, who has worked on a ridiculous number of blockbuster hits (When Harry Met Sally..., City Slickers, The Addams Family, Sister Act, Sleepless in Seattle, A Few Good Men, The American President, The First Wives Club, George of the Jungle, In & Out, Patch Adams, South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut, Team America: World Police, Hairspray, Flipped, and Mary Poppins Returns). He also contributed much of the music to the 1988 Hairspray. The album is great. Definitely a much more traditional sound than what I have listened to so far, but I absolutely love it. I never realized that the movie had such a homerun soundtrack. Good stuff, and a lot of interesting history/ connections.",
"Another listening for composition lessons, this time Darcy James Argue. He’s a Canadian- American jazz composer and bandleader known especially for his big band, the 18 piece Secret Society. He studied at McGill University before moving to the US, where he studied with Bob Brookmeyer at the New England Conservatory. This album, released in 2009, is the Society’s first album. It was nominated for a Grammy, starting the long strain of success experienced by the ensemble. This album is really amazing, and I’m only two tracks in. A concept which just hit me- this album differentiates itself by using instruments in ways you wouldn’t normally expect. For example, in the second track, Zeno, the electric guitar places a muted ostinato which is taken up by piano underneath a trombone solo. I don’t recall hearing too many strict ostinatos in a big band setting, let alone in muted electric guitar. Super cool sound that I would not have expected. And there are a million examples of this all over the place. Shortly after that bit, it sounds like trumpets are playing little colorations with open harmon mute and hand stopping. There’s just so many little details, and I absolutely love it. It’s like- rock vs. prog rock; big band vs. Secret Society. I definitely hear some Brookmeyer-isms in here as well especially in terms of the form, development of ideas, and little metrical things. They aren’t purely Brookmeyer, to be fair- stuff like that certainly pops up on a multitude of works. But, they were at least things which stuck out to me in Hello, Goodbye. In other news, I swear I have heard Transit before. I think maybe John Tocco had me listen to it before? I just checked, and yup- listened to it in the Summer of 2019. Interesting to see that I had roughly the same things to say about it back then- color, form, mix of jazz and contemporary styles. Super super cool, I love these listening logs. Halfway through Redeye, there was some wicked cool production stuff going on. Overall just a super sick album.",
"I haven’t heard a ton of stuff by Ligeti, but I like all that I have heard. That trombone fanfare, his Requiem, and the Music Ricertata. The composition date of these pieces was split between 1988 and 1993. The works feature text by mostly Lewis Caroll (English Writer, Alice in Wonderland), one Victorian era prose, and lastly the Alphabet. The collection is largely a parody of many styles and genres, most notable of Renaissance period madrigalism (multiple texts, different tempos, et cetera). I totally love these pieces. They’re so witty and fun to listen to, with there layered musical meanings as well as musical lines. That madrigalism parody is very evident now that I am listening to it. I particularly like the second Cuckoo movement. Also, on the topic of choir- the extended techniques he makes use of are super cool. For example, having the vocalists intentionally sound nasally. I dig it. The third movement, Alphabet, gives me really intense Requiem micropolyphony vibes. I might describe this more as a wall of sound than micropolyphony, but in either case, the effect is rather close. I would describe this as a still pond, while micropolyphony is a turbulent lake. I really like how the fourth movement, Flying Robert, ended. This sort of slow dying away. Might be useful to try someday.",
"I listened to Fur Alina last semester (which feels like forever ago), but nothing outside of that. Dr. Smith played this for us last week in Choral Arranging, and I really dug it. It was composed in 1980, a year after he left his native Estonia, and it is a setting of the popular Psalm 130. I heard Gubaidulina’s take of this psalm in her piece for accordion, which featured heavily in the film I watched last week, The Killing of a Sacred Deer. It is inspired by the works of Renaissance composers like Josquin de Pres, and it features his Tintinnabulation style of writing. It is written for a male choir in four parts, organ, and percussion. Such a cool piece, so deep but so full. I’d like to point out, given the last piece, how many of our 20th century composers in the Western Cannon (Part, Ligeti, and even Stravinsky), had this deep seated fascination with Renaissance and Late Renaissance music (like de Pres and Gesualdo). I love weird loops. I also love how almost quasi minimalist this piece is, and how it spins out material consistently before just dying out. Almost like the cries for help in the actual text.",
"A little single from an upcoming album, I believe. Just a super super cool track, probably one of my favorite things I’ve ever heard by him. It’s just so warm and beautiful, while also being totally unique from a lot of the other stuff he has done (if not from Personal Shopper, then almost definitely from most stuff by Porcupine Tree). Just had to say that about it- definitely a massively good study in arrangement of a tune.",
"Shane recommended this one after me and Ross were discussing De Profundis in the Discord. He composed this in 1996 for the 900th anniversary of the Norwich Chapel in the UK. The piece draws from John 15: 1–14, where Jesus uses the parable I am the true vine. Much similar to Genesis One for the Vine, the vine imagery is used as a call for people to love one another (and in the case of the Genesis tune, the call seems to be ignored). Part uses a systematic cycling of material six times throughout the piece, which in conjunction with hocket and registral shifts, creates the impression of vines shooting upwards. Once again, his callbacks to the past are clear. The numerology and religious parabology is more medieval than Renaissance, but given the cathedral he was writing for (built in 1096), the parallels still make a lot of sense. I didn’t like this piece as much as De Profundis, as it felt like it went on a little too long maybe. At the same time though, it is certainly reminiscent of that period anyways.",
"I love Germaine, something about neoclassicism in the French Style is so good. I don’t really wanna write anything about this, and would rather just sit back and enjoy it for fifteen minutes",
"John wanted me to use the tune Lullaby for Nancy as a reference track on the tune we are working on together, so I decided to listen to the whole thing. It was released in 1973, and it like crossover easy listening jazz. Overall pretty cheesy, but I didn’t mind it too much. It sounded pretty clean or being released in the early 70’s. Lullaby for Nancy was easily the highlight of the whole album. So beautiful.",
"Didn’t really give this a close listen, but I did have it on while I showered this morning. They are an indie folk band founded by singer songwriter Justin Vernon in 2006. Overall liked the album quite a bit. Pretty laid back and moody, but in a sentimental sort of way. I can see why Taylor wanted them on Folklore. Apparently Colin Stetson is a touring member, which is pretty neat. Definitely an album I would listen to again, and I probably will listen again.",
"These guys released two tunes for the first time in a whiiiiiile this week, so I decided to actually check out one of their albums. They are an Armenian-American metal band that formed in 1994. Despite a fairly small output, they achieved a massive amount of success in a short period of time (they broke up in 2006). They boast only five studio albums, and the two recently released songs. Much of their musical identity revolves around their Armenian Heritage and their recognition of the Armenian Genocide. The tunes released this week cover the civil war occuring between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Many of their lyrics deal with such political issues, as well as other Dadaist stances. Once again I didn’t listen super closely, but I did enjoy what I heard. I definitely heard some hints of TOOL, but a little more straight ahead. I particularly enjoyed the opening track Prison Song, which is a criticism of the War on Drugs and Mass Incarceration in the US. Sadly, not much has changed. They also remind me a bit of earlier metal, like Iron Maiden. Definitely gotta listen to some more of their stuff.",
"I have quite a bit of logging to get caught up on before my jury next week, so I’m gonna do a quick rundown of the music I’ve listened to in the last few weeks (which is admittedly smaller than it should be. I might use winter break to get caught up on all the shit I have on my mental list). So, John told me to listen to this short EP as I start sorta finishing up my own. It is actually quite similar to what I want in terms of structure and content, so it was very fun to listen to. One big takeaway from it is that I definitely want to keep the arrangement very intimate and personal where I can. Oh, and Bridgers is pretty cool. She is currently only 26, but she has experienced quite a bit of success recently. She was nominated for four Grammy’s this year! This EP is her most recent release, with her second album Punisher having been released in November and her debut album Stranger in the Alps in 2017. I definitely want to check out those at some point, and recommend her stuff to Dylan",
"This tune is WILD. He released it as a single last month, and it just… wow. I think the contrast between this and last year’s 1,111 Violin Concerto is just staggering. This tune is like a throwback to his Oingo Boingo Burlesque, but taken to an existential extreme. I mean, the lyrics, the music, the video. It’s totally Clown Core meets Nightmare Before Christmas. I kinda hate it, but I can’t look away. High key hoping he releases a full album full of shit like this, just so I can scare people in my car. Puppy! (fucker) Puppy! (fucker) Puppy! (fucker). Super unforgettable.",
"Another release from Steven Wilson’s Future Bites Sessions. Not much to say about this in specific, other than that it is up there with King Ghost as my favorite thing I’ve heard by him. Just a super beautiful tune, and I don’t even know what it’s about yet! I don’t exactly know what his plans are with this Future Bites album, but I’m excited to see it. So far, all he did was sell a single physical copy (The Ultra Deluxe something or another on outdated media) for like 13k. I hope we can stream it at some point with all of these wonderful tunes in one place, but that remains to be seen.",
"John told me to listen to this album (as well as all of Stevie’s other stuff), but this is all I’ve gotten to so far. There is a looooooot of info about Stevie, but a basic overview is that he was a hugely influential figure in developing R&B, fostering in the album era, as well as inspiring musicians from genres such as rhythm and blues, pop, soul, gospel, funk and jazz. He started out as a virtual one man band, and went on to become one of the most successful songwriters and musicians of all time. This album, released in 1973, is said to be his transition into a more mature style (his middle period). It heavily features the ARP Synthesizer throughout, and is largely a one man band. The album deals with many themes as well: The nine tracks of Innervisions encompass a wide range of themes and issues: from drug abuse in Too High, through inequality and systemic racism in Living for the City, to love in the ballads All in Love Is Fair and Golden Lady. The albums closer, Hes Misstra Know-It-All, is a scathing attack on then-US President Richard Nixon, similar to Wonders song a year later, You Havent Done Nothin.[4] Living for the City was one of the first soul music songs to deal explicitly with systemic racism and to use everyday sounds of the street such as traffic, voices and sirens, which were combined with the music recorded in the studio. This innovation is certainly evident while listening. Hard to believe this was released in 73’. I’m super excited to listen to more of his stuff, which I know is textbook- I’m slow getting up to speed, sometimes!",
"Deemer told me to listen to this- he thought some of my lyrics remind him of this later period Ben Folds. This was released in 2015 as a collaboration with the ensemble yMusic. It is soooooooo good. A lot like Rockin’ the Suburbs, I’ve been listening to it on a repeat for a while now. Something about Ben’s lyrics are just so genuine and intimate. The fact that my lyrics reminded someone of him is a massive compliment, I think. It was also super cool to hear his style translated to a chamber-ish setting. It just works so unbearably well. I particularly like the tune Phone in a Pool. Such beautiful, heartbreaking music. He is quickly becoming one of my musical idols, for sure. I mean, I used the term Ben Foldsian unironically yesterday. Also worth mentioning that yMusic has collaborated with a lot of big and varied names including Chris Thile, Missy Massoli, and Sufjan Stevens. Wild stuff- definitely need to keep an eye on them!",
"They released this album this week, and I listened to quite a bit of it. It’s fun to see all of their die hard fans getting super angry about it, since it’s definitely not their older style. This is much much more focused on synthesizers and pop sensibilities more than anything else. I enjoy the sound, but I think this album goes on wayyyyyyy too long. I’ve noticed that a lot of the melodic ideas that Billy writes tend to sound like each other, and I think that is very very evident in this album. After the first few tracks, it begins sounding far too repetitive for my taste. I think the singles they released are pretty fantastic, along with a few of the other tracks, but I definitely wish there was a bit more variation in terms of content across the whole thing. Definitely something to consider as I continue constructing my EP.",
"I’ve been meaning to get into Fiona’s music for a while, and since Ryan Terry presented on one of the tunes from this album yesterday, I decided to give it a listen. Apple is an American singer-songwriter from NYC. She got into music at a very young age, writing her first tunes at the age of eight. At 12 she was raped, which propelled her to move to LA with her father. She reports that the event never makes it into her songs, as it is a dull and boring pain. She was signed to Sony in 1994, which is when her string of successes in the industry began. Since then, she has released 5 albums and participated in a plethora of collaborations. She is also philanthropist of sorts, often donating large sums of money to various social justice and political advocacy groups. This album, known in full as The Idler Wheel Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do, is her fourth album released in 2012. Her previous album had many delays with release, so she produced this album under the nose of her record company as a sort of escapism. She also chose to produce it with her drummer Charley Drayton rather than her long time collaborator Jon Brion. The album was enormously successful upon release, and was nominated a Grammy for Best Alternative Album in 2013. First track already got me. Every Single Night is about accepting yourself in the face of your self doubts. Lyrically, it’s a masterwork. So good. The tune Jonathan was also really cool. She wrote it about one of her ex-boyfriends, and on the first night of recording, she happened to be walking by a bottle making factory with her producer. They decided the sound was really cool, so they did some recordings which became the basis for the piece. The industrial beat mixed with everything else is wicked freaking cool. I really want to know how they got the piano sound they did. It sounds like it has less body to it, as if it is being struck with something harder than felt hammers. At times, it just sounds like an old upright slightly out of tune. It definitely has a vibe. Werewolf also makes of field recordings- in this instance, a group of kids screaming and popping balloons. They had to remove the balloon pops since they sounded too much like gunshots, but the effect is wicked cool. I also have to say that I absolutely love her voice. It’s so deep and raw, and it totally fits her style of writing. It has the the same sort of straightforward type of sound that you might see with Ben Folds, but much more raw and gritty. Straightforward isn’t a great word either. There are some really beautiful analogies and imagery, but its so tasteful and easy to follow. The chorus from Regret is perfect. I’ve run out of white doves’ feathers to soak up the hot piss that comes from your mouth everytime you address me. God. And the tune Hot Knife is just sooooooo cool. Voice, piano, and TIMPANI. Like, WHAT!?!?!? And it’s all so fucking tight. Like, they are so in the pocket. Apple’s sister, the other vocalist, said that weaving their voices together in the studio was one of the most intimate moments of their lives. You can totally tell when listening. This album- undoubtedly- a 10/10 in my book. It feels like listening to Rockin the Suburbs for the first time. Definitely excited to listen to more of her stuff.",
"A recommendation from Joanna. Hozier is an Irish singer-songwriter. He was raised in the Quaker faith, and although he now identifies as agnostic, that upbringing greatly influenced his world view. He is an outspoken critic of the Catholic church, and a philanthropist in both his music and otherwise. He released two EP’s, both of which were massive successes. This album, released in 2014, is his debut studio album after those two EP’s. It draws tunes from them, as well as a lot of original material as well. The first tune Take me to Church, drawn from the debut EP of the same name, was nominated a Grammy for Song of the Year. The album was a massive success, and I can understand why. It feels like halfway between Ben Folds and Ed Sheeran, but with a sort of edge that neither really has. The vocal processing is very interesting. I feel as though the reverb on them is much wetter than I’m used to hearing in this type of music, and there is definitely some soft distortion on them in certain tunes. At times the tunes sound folky, then rock, then heavy blues. It seems to seamlessly combines elements of these relatively similar genres into something that is totally unique. I might also call this the Rolling Stones mixed with Martha Wainwright. These comparisons are so intuitive and arbitrary sometimes, but I love the contextualization of style they provide in my head. I think it’s a useful tactic, at least. It’s fun to do as well. Overall a decent album. Not my favorite thing in the world, but definitely pretty solid the whole way through. Despite all the unique genre bending, I think it still has this core sound that’s super cliche. I guess that’s my apprehension with loving this- I’m still jaded from exposure to that archetypal sound. Again, some interesting stuff going on- just not super in my range of preferred tastes.",
"I heard her do the last track of this on a Tiny Desk Concert last night, and I simply couldn’t resist diving int0 the full thing. This is her second studio album, released in 2020 and recorded between 2018 and 2019. It is described as an indie rock or emo folk album which explores themes of disassociation. It was released this June in the midst of the George Floyd protests and the Covid pandemic. It was originally scheduled to be released on Junteenth, but she moved the date earlier and encouraged fans to donate to racial justice organization. She also stated that she wouldn’t delay the release because she didn’t want thing to go back to normal. That said, I’m very excited to hear what this is all about. Ugh this is SOOOOOOOO good. Halloween was amazing because of the non musical sounds and extended techniques used before. I also loved the tune Kyoto. Honestly too much to say about what’s happening in here. It’s just so gorgeous. Chinese Sattelite is fucking heartbreaking. Moon Song does a really cool high pass filter on the drums that give it this sort of detached, dream like quality. This is definitely something I might want to exploit in my last tune. Savior C0mplex is only verses, with no chorus. Graceland Too is such a beautiful of hope for the better. I Know the End. Fuck. I think this might be a perfect album. I cried on like 5 separate occasions during listening. So fucking good, I can’t even fully express it. It might have just made top 10 albums for me. Jesus.",
"Dave worked on this, so I thought I’d give it a listen. HAIM is an American pop rock band from San Fernando Valley California. It consists of three sisters, Este, Danielle, and Alana. They started out playing wedding gigs, but quickly grew into the scene. They formed in 2007, but not consider it a viable professional career until 2012 (just after Danielle had spent some time as a touring guitarist for a couple well known groups). They have been described as a 70’s-esque pop rock band with an R&B influence. They currently boast three albums, with this being their most recent. It was released in June as one of the most highly anticipated albums of the year. It has been nominated for Album of the Year at this years Grammy’s, and Dave mixed tracks 1, 4, and 9. I think his style is super evident in the 4th track. It’s so cronchy and wide, with a lot of really cool little productional elements. In that regard, it reminds me a lot of the stuff off Ok Go’s Of the Blue Color of the Sky. I definitely like that tune (Up From a Dream) a lot. Especially the alarm at the end of the tune. I was just talking with Graham about how cool it could be to use those stressor sounds in a musical context. Overall, this whole album feels like a giant fuck you- to the world, to life, to the industry. I dig it. Another interesting thing about this album is how quickly the style seems to change. There’s definitely a thread of commonality in the lyrical style and the core instrumentation, but the groove and overall feel of each tune can vary pretty greatly. The tune 3am, for example, definitely has like an early 2000’s (or maybe 90’s) pop sound with a solid hip hop backbeat (which in many ways, was a characteristic of early 2000’s pop). Contrast that with Up From a Dream, and I think it’s easy to see the skill and stylistic flexibility of this group. A specific detail- in the chorus of Don’t Wanna, I like how they rotate the syllabic stresses on those words. It’s a really simple way to break up the feel of the melody. Reminds me of something I might hear in music by Prince. I also really liked the last track FUTB, particularly the ending. Just some wicked cool noise stuff going on. I definitely need to consider those types of elements as I write my EP. Overall I really liked this album, and I can certainly understand the Grammy nomination (not that Grammy’s are or should be the end all be all of quality). I think this album does a lot of neat things to take a stock sound and make it something unique.",
"I loved Idler Wheel, and John has been raving about this one, so here I am. This was released in April of this year, and it is in fact her first album (number 5) since Idler in 2012. She recorded it over the course of five years largely as an experimentation. The album places heavy focus on percussion, particularly found objects. She attributes this to her childhood OCD, which dictated she walk in strict rhythmic structures. It is a concept album focusing on themes of confinement, with the title referring to the desire to remove oneself from a situation they are not happy with. Apple recorded the album mostly on her own with Garageband, and due to her lack of experience with the program, this led to oftentimes long takes and unedited vocals. Upon release, it was deemed an instant classic. Shameika certainly seems it. What a cool tune. I think the tune Relay is interesting, since it is about her rape. She stated prior that she never wanted to write a tune about it, but here we are. Apparently the tipping point for her was the hearings for Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. It’s really poetic to see that change in attitude, and I hope more like her are able to voice themselves in that regard. Overall a pretty cool album. I had a hard time focusing during the second half because of some drama I’m dealing with, but I’ll give it a relisten sometime soon. Very cool, but definitely like Idler Wheel more, I think.",
"Time for some 80’s mainstream rock/pOpus  I think someone on Facebook mentioned this album, which is convenient seeing how often her name pops up in Fiona Apple and Phoebe Bridgers discussions. Bush was an English singer, songwriter, musician, and record producer. She topped charts with her first single at the age of 19 (1978), and from that point on experiences a string of successes internationally. Despite the long length of time between albums, her influence is incredibly widespread. Everyone from Prince to Steven Wilson (Yes, Steven Wilson) states her as a source of influence. This album, her fifth, was released in 1985. Her prior album, which explored progressive rock ideas, was not terribly well received, so the success of this one was a huge comeback for her. She fashioned a 24 track recording studio in her family barn which she could use whenever she wanted. The first half of the album is titled Hounds of Love, whilst the second, titled Ninth Wave, is a concept suite about someone drifting alone at sea. The album is largely pop rock and art rock, though many consider it to be post-progressive rock (Essentially 70’s prog rock but more minimalist and less focused on largely male perspectives- a pitfall of the genre I had never even considered). The album was incredibly well received on release, garnering numerous accolades and being called by many one of the greatest albums of all time. This album is not at all what I was expecting. It seems to have a lot of sounds I might expect from my (admittedly limited) experience with 80’s pop, but there’s also a lot of other unique things. For starters, the lyrical style (particularly the phrasing) seems to be very wish-washy, for lack of a better term. It feels less concerned with having clear sectional delineations in the text, and more with setting it in a unique way. It certainly draws my attention to it, and makes it sound more analogous to speaking text than singing it over a groove. In that regard, it reminds me a looooooot of Fiona Apple and Phoebe Bridgers. Something about the way their lyrics are structured on that scale is so intuitive and free. The subject matter of some of the tunes is pretty intense. Mother Stands for Comfort is about a mothers unconditional love for her daughter, even though she has murdered someone. There are also themes of drowning on the second half, which is something more analogous thematically to early and late prog rock than anything else. Wicked interesting. There also seems to be a heavy emphasis on the synth pop sound in quite a few of the tunes, which I suppose was pretty common in popular styles of this period. Maybe that just sticks out because the 80’s are one of my weakest periods. I mean, even the gated reverb on the snare sticks out because I’m not super used to it. I do like the sound though, and want to get into it more. I also have some alt/punk rock stuff I want to check out at some point, so it might be cool to explore these styles in tandem. There’s just so much music out there! But, I want to make sure I’m as well rounded as possible. And Dream of Sheep starts the second conceptual half of the album, which introduces someone lost at sea and trying not to drown. Under Ice is the one where they have a dream about drowning, and it was very distressing. Something about the droning synth strings, chant like vocals, and distant cries/ambient sounds. Wicked cool. Fucking Waking the Witch. My God did this tune catch me off guard! It’s like industrial, glitch, ambient, New Wave, experimental. So freakin cool. A comment on Genius remarked on the mix quality, and I could not agree more. To think this was all done on 24 tracks. And then JIG OF LIFE OUT OF LEFT FIELD WITH THE CELTIC GROOVE. This album is Whack af. Hello Earth is super beautiful- the last breaths of this woman drowning just as she’s about to be rescued. Crazy good stuff. I think this tune in particular had the strongest prog rock vibes. The ambient sounds, alternate languages, and chanting. Very colorful. Overall a cool album, not at all what I was expecting. It’s a really interesting mix of various styles, and super unique in its handling of them. I’m not the biggest fan in the world, as a lot of it felt a tad awkward to me, but I can definitely appreciate it for its ideas, craft, and context. I’ll certainly be listening to quite a few of the tunes in my free time.",
"Another recommendation from John. D’Angelo is an American multi instrumentalist and producer associated with the Neo Soul movement. He currently has three albums, all of which were wildly successful and influential. He sites Prince, Fela Kuti, and James Brown as influences. This album, released in 2000, is his second album. It features a groove based funk sound, and it was very well received upon release. During the albums conception, D’Angelo expressed dissatisfaction with R&B music. He claimed it was becoming synonymous with pop, and turning into a night club thing. This album is his attempt to reclaim the heritage of the style. Many claim it sounds like Bobby McPherin on opium. That said, I’m very excited to dive in. Overall a pretty solid album. Certainly very heavy on the groove and bass, and it was very easy to listen to. I could definitely see myself putting this on in the background while doing work or something.",
"Definitely listened to this with dad when I was younger, so I decided to do a dive. It is their sixth album, released in 2000. It represents a much more pop influenced end of the bands sound, and it is also the last album before their progressive metal phase (starting with In Absentia in 2002). Steven Wilson states that it was their fastest album, and remains their best work. It does not have a unifying concept, although their are four or five tunes about the different stages of a relationship. It was well received upon release. Immediately, their style of writing (even within a more pop inspired idiom) is immediately evident. The melodicism that Steven employs is very distinct in a way which I cannot quite place my finger on. It might just be the timbre of his voice, but I certainly like it in any case. There are also the double tracked guitars and non musical noises that are very In Absentia. I really really liked the tune Shesmovedon. Just wicked cool. Overall a really great album. I’m already listening to it again",
"John keeps sending me album recommendations, and although I have many other things I need to listen to, I can’t help but checking out his stuff. I’ve loved nearly every thing he has suggested, so I take it very seriously. Mars is an American singer, songwriter, record producer, musician, and dancer. He was born in Hawaii, but moved to LA in 2003 to pursue a career in music. He is known for his retro stage presence and wide palette of musical styles. He is accompanied by his band, the Hooligans. He only has three studio albums, but boasts a plethora of singles and concert tours. He is one of the highest paid musicians as of 2016. His racial ambiguity has led to many accusations of cultural appropriation, but many affluent black artists have denounced the claim. Mars states that such ambiguity has been very difficult, and in spite of it, does all he can to pay respect to the artists who inspired him. This album, released in 2016, is his most recent. It represents a diversion from his more pop influenced style of writing and into the more 90’s R&B inspired music which he loved so much growing up as a kid. It won seven Grammys and is one of the best selling albums of the 2010’s. Overall I enjoyed this album a lot. Very very VERY groove heavy, which is refreshing. I’d say it reminds of Prince in that way, but that’s just because I don’t listen to stuff in this genre much. I definitely need to do more.",
"I was listening to Lightbulb Sun with Graham today, and he told me I should check these guys out. I’ve been meaning to for quite some time now, so I’ve decided to finally just do it. QOTSA is an American rock band that formed in 1996 in California. It has gone through many lineup changes, but John Homme has been there the whole time. They have been described as alternative rock, hard rock, stoner rock, and alternative metal. Due to lineup changes and collaborations, they have close associations with groups like Nirvana, The Mars Volta, the Foo Fighters, and the Smashing Pumpkins. This album, their second, was released in 2000, and it is what launched them into the mainstream. It is considered to be alternative rock and stoner rock (mixing elements of heavy metal with psychedelic rock), and it largely explores themes of drug usage. It was very well received on release, and many consider it to be their best record. I just read that John doesn’t particularly like the label stoner rock, largely because their tunes don’t endorse usage. I wasn’t a huge fan of the album, but pretty solid. Costanza said I should check out a different album",
"I have no memory of who recommended me this album, but it was on my list, so here I am. Bibio (Stephen Wilkinson) is an English musician known for his folk-oriented, electronic, and experimental works. He showed an interest in found sounds very early early in his musical career. This, combined with his use of synthesizers and guitars, led to a cohesive form of music which many dubbed intelligent dance music (that is, dance music more intended for listening than actual dancing. It was largely a 90’s thing). In addition to his 10 studio albums, his music has also been licensed for ad campaigns by groups such as L.L. Bean and Amazon. This album, his 7th, was released in 2013. He stated that he wanted this album to sound more organic and live than his previous albums. It was released tepid reviews, with most ranking it somewhere in the 70% bandwidth. Despite this, it charted at 17 in the US Billboard Top Electronic/Dance Albums. Overall I found the album to be sort of boring. Maybe it just isn’t my thing, but it felt very static. I oftentimes feel that way about Minimalist music as well. The colors and textures are really well integrated and cohesive, but it kinda just dragged on. I could def have this on while studying or something, but I don’t really think I would sit down just to listen to this. Definitely a lot to learn from it and very well done, but I wasn’t a huge fan otherwise.",
"I saw Dr. Smith listening to this a while back, so I put it on my list. Cam brought it up at yesterdays meeting, so here I am. Maroon 5 is an American pop rock band from California. Adam Levine formed the group in 1994 as Kara’s Flowers with some friends while still in high school. There have been some staff turnovers since, but Adam Levine remains and many of the founders still remain. The group draws from a variety of influences and styles. They currently have 6 albums under their current name, many of which were widespread successes. This album, released in 2002, is their debut under the Maroon 5 name. It released along with 5 singles to widespread acclaim, charting internationally. Overall, this album is amazing. Musically it’s a pretty cool sound, clearly drawing from pop, rock, and other influences like Soul and R&B (Again, according to my very limited listening experience in those styles). It def comes across as more pop-rock, though. The real shit about this album is the mix. It is so unbelievably clean and clear. Everything sits so well without sounding muddy or crowded. This is especially evident in the vocals, which have this unobstructive floating, creamy quality. Sunday Morning might be my new reference mix. Super good album. Joanna suggested I listen to Overexposed, so I will have to check that one out at some point.",
"Don’t remember where I got this recommendation, but I see people listening to it a lot. They were an Irish rock band that formed in 1989. They only had one member change (the lead vocalist became Dolores ORiordan in 1990), and the lineup remained the same until their breakup in 2019. They took a break from 2003 to 2009 to pursue individual careers, but they all remained on good terms. The group broke up after O’Riordan drowned in a hotel bathtub from alcohol poisoning. The group finished their final In the End, which was underway at the time, and then dissolved the group. Their career was long and very successful, earning them several Grammy’s and numerous Billboard spots in various times and places. They are known for mixing elements of Irish folk music with post-punk rock, alternative rock, and pop rock. This album, released in 1994, is their second of eight. I tis their most successful album to date, and contains their immensely popular single Zombie. Despite it’s markedly heavier sound from their first album, it was very well received on release and solidified their place in mainstream musical culture. Maybe it’s because I’m tired, but I really just can’t get my head around this album. It’s sooooooo slow, but in a bad way. It’s like the bad parts of punk rock, minus the potatoes (sorry). It’s not bad per se, but I just don’t like it all that much. Especially considering that this is their heavier album, I cannot imagine what their other stuff is like.",
"I’ve never heard of this guy, but it was announced yesterday that he passed away on the 31st. A lot of people I know where really upset about it, and since it’s the first day of the new year, I figured it was the perfect opportunity to check him out. Daniel Dumile (known by his stage name MF Doom) was a British-American rapper. He debuted during the Golden Era of Hip Hop (the late 1980’s), and was a major player in the underground scene during the early 21st century. Now I’m loosely familiar with what Hip Hop music is, but I’m going to write out a definition from Wikipedia just so I’m not totally in the dark. Hip Hop (also known as rap) is a type of popular music that developed out of inner city Afreican American and Latino Americans in the Bronx during the 1970’s. It is a type of rhythmic music which accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech which is chanted (So if I am understanding, Hip Hop loosely refers to the music itself, which underpins the technique of rapping). Yes that’s correct, wiki says Rap is not a required component of hip hOpus  The style also developed out of Hip Hop culture, which is defined by MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. This arose because of the increasing popularity of block parties, in which DJ’s would use multiple records to play instrumental breaks over which others could rap. The genre did not hit air until 1979, at which point it went through various eras of development. Dumile was born in London, but moved to Long Island at a young age. He began his career in 1988 with the group KDM. They disbanded in 1993, at which point he began performing at open mics with his current persona and famous Dr. Doom-esque mask. This album, released in 1999, was his debut album and the beginning of a very prolific career which spanned most of the early 2000’s to late 2010’s. It is considered one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time. It opens up with samples from the Fantastic Four, setting a tone which I was not at all expecting but totally dig. I must admit that almost all of these references are lost on me, but I can still appreciate the depth and complexity of what he is saying. I’m getting little thematic hints which are pretty fascinating, like drawing a parallel between the flow of rap and the flow of a superhero movie script. I can’t even imagine what it must be like to experience this music with the cultural understanding it requires. This once again reminds of the importance of cultural appropriation. This is a type of music that I could never write, and even moreso, a style I wouldn’t even want to touch. I don’t have the proper experience or understanding. In many ways, this makes me appreciate it even more. I would say I rest somewhere in the middle of the musical Dunning Kruger curve, which means that I understand how little I truly know about this style. But at the same time, I feel as though I know enough general ideas to understand it’s complexity and importance. Really cool stuff. That said, I don’t think this is necessarily something I would listen to casually. I was looking through my music library last night with Ross, and he remarked on how White it is. My music library is very white, especially because I like prog rock so much. There are certainly black artists I like quite a bit (such as Lizzo, numerous jazz artists, Mahalia, Kendrick Lamar, Benjamin Clemetine), but in general, it is quite white. I think it’s safe to say that this is a result of not only my upbringing, but also my cultural identity. I feel as though a lot of these Black styles of music are so far from a lot of my understanding that much of their meaningful content is lost to me. I certainly enjoy digging in and broadening my horizons, but at the end of the day, I would rather have a cheeseburger than chinese food. It’s just what I know and understand best. This does not mean, however, that I am going to stop expanding my horizons. There’s a lot to love and appreciate, and I want to continue to embrace that.",
"If I recall correctly, I saw a bassist on YouTube do a pretty hip cover of one of Lipa’s tunes, so here I am. She is a British model and singer (currently only 25 years old). She began a career in modeling at age 16 with the hopes of meeting people who could help her pursue a career in music. This album was her 2017 debut, and it solidified her place in the industry. Although she only has two albums currently, she has won numerous awards and has spent a fair amount of time on the charts both in the US and abroad. She cites Pink, Jamiroquai, Kendrick Lamar, and Chance the Rapper as notable influences. She is described as dark pop with synth pop and R&B elements. I’m looking at the personnel list while listening, and it reminds me of HAIM in the sense that there are sooooooo many different musicians, engineers, and writers involved. I guess that’s the trend of the future- pop albums are massively collaborative from track to track to get a very specific sound. At least, that would be my guess. I suppose it’s no different from what I want to do with my EP, but dialed up to the craziest extreme. I find it amazing that the albums don’t lose coherence in spite of this. So far it reminds me a lot of Lizzo, but white and like watered down British. Not necessarily a bad thing, but I would definitely rather just listen to Lizzo I think. This album also just feels too long. I’m only a little over halfway, and I already want it to be done. Overall not bad, but I don’t really like this sorta sound. It might not be fair to compare this to Lizzo purely, since almost everything popular these days has an R&B influence, but my gut reaction is there are other artists I’d rather listen to doing this stuff.",
"My cousin Megan recommended this to me. Miller (white) was an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer from Pennsylvania. He started in the Pittsburgh hip hop scene in 2007, and by 2010, he had a record deal to release some of his mixtapes. From there, he went on to numerous collaborations, releases, and commercial successes throughout his early to mid twenties. His early works are frat rap (focusing on themes of fraternity life), but he later became much more experimental. He struggled with depression and substance abuse his whole life, which also became a theme in his music. He died of an accidental drug overdose in September of 2018 at age 26. This album is the fourth of his mixtapes to be released (thereby predating his first studio album). The title is in reference to the 1995 film of the same name, and it is also an acronym for Kickin’ Incredibly Dope Shit. I’m googling a bit, as I listen, because I’m once again sort of hesitant about a black style of music being done by a pretty white dude. I found one really cool article (linked below) about his posthumous legacy, and how many of the most prominent hip hop artists of the time considered him to be one of the only true white rap artists. The author actually used this album as justification, which really shows how Miller found his niche in a style not made for him. The argument is that he presents himself as a true storyteller. The opening line ,When you’re young, not much matters. When you find something that you care about, then that’s all you got, shows that he is speaking only to his experience. The album focuses on his childhood experience, things like skipping school to smoke weed, and for that reason he comes across as genuine. I can’t really be one to judge, but something about this does come across as sincere and very heartfelt. I don’t know why- if it’s something intrinsic to0 the music or just my own internal influences- but I certainly feel it. In fact, the article says ...you can Google Mac Miller beside phrases like the n-word or cultural appropriation, looking to find a flaw but your search will run dry. I goggled exactly that, and this was the only really good result. That said, since I am listening to this, I feel I owe it to the community to experience more examples by artists who created the style. I might use names mentioned in the article here as a springboard of exploration. Imagine me, knowing only Mac Miller for Hip HOpus  Certainly that isn’t entirely true, but to an extent it sort of is. I want to dive a little deeper. I also had a short conversation with Prince about it, and he sorta had the same things to say about Miller. It’s all about truly experiencing, understanding, and respecting the culture. Miller did, but there are many white rappers who don’t (and are doing it for the shock factor…. Like some people I know). Super cool stuff, and in many ways, I like it even more. This is a style of music I will never be able to touch, simply because I don’t have the experience or true understanding. All I can do is appreciate it from a distance, and that’s a neat feeling. This album in particular is also kinda cool simply because Miller is white. In many ways, it almost helps to bridge my understanding a bit, since I can more closely identify with his lyrics and even musical ideas to an extent. Overall a really fantastic album that led to a really enlightening and humbling conversation.",
"David Byrne. The man, the myth, the legend. I’m no stranger to some of his work, but this has been on my list for a long time. I heard he wrote another concert film, but I haven’t yet gotten around to watching it. I’m only going to listen to the music for the time being, but I fully intend on watching the actual film soon, because it has gotten incredible reviews. Alan Theisen also wrote quite a bit about David Byrne in his new publication, so I’ll have to read that. Correction- the album is a standalone thing, but the film is a live adaptation of the album (with modification). Still- gotta watch it. The film was released in 2020, but the album was released in 2018. The album was released as part of a larger project called Reasons to Be Cheerful, which is meant to spread positivity in the midst of all the stuff that’s been going on these last free years. Reviews on release were generally favorable, and it received a Grammy nomination for Best Alternative Album. This album was fuckign awesome. I mean, it is David Byrne. But my god is it cool. It’s like the domestic themes of the Talking Heads pushed to a modern day extreme. Brain Eno also had a huge hand in this album, it seems, leading to a very colorful wall of sound sort of vibe. This combined with non standard instruments and various sound/productional effects leads to something halfway between the Talking Heads and Fiona Apple. Just super beautiful. Also, Alan Theisen’s review of the show was miraculous. Demme’s Show [Stop Making Sense] is about finding your brotherhood; Lee’s is about honoring your obligations to them.",
"Gordon Matthew Sumner CBE (The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire), known to most as Sting, is a British Bassist, singer, songwriter, and actor. He was the bassist for the new wave rock band the Police from 1977 to 1984, and in 1985 he embarked on a solo career. He has received 17 total Grammy Awards between his solo career and work with the Police, with Every Breath You Take being certified by BMI as the most played radio song of all time. His name comes from the yellow jumper he wore early in his career, and he no longer even recognizes the name Gordon. He has been a part of many collaborations, including a joint tour with Peter Gabriel in 2016. He is considered to be one of the most successful songwriters of the 20th century. This album, released in 1993, is Sting’s fourth solo studio album. It is a play on words of Sting’s last name and and a character in Geoffrey Chaucers The Canterbury Tales, the summoner. It was a recorded in Lake House and was nominated for six Grammy’s. It was also the first item ever purchased securely over the internet. Love is Stronger than Justice is a solid 7/4 bOpus  Fields of Gold also stands out in that it doesn’t have any choruses, just verses. I don’t really know why it works in this case, but it totally does. I’m gonna have to listen to it quite a few times. Overall this album was pretty good. It came across as a bit cheesy at times, but it had a lot of charm that overshadowed that for the most part. It sounds like it’s halfway between Chicago and the Police, which is kinda neat. I think the second track was my favorite, although I’ve been doom scrolling (Capital Building Raid) for most of it. Solid stuff overall though. I think it shines through with it’s simple arrangement, as it still manages to convey a lot of really interesting musical ideas with a pretty simple layout. Sting also has a super distinct voice that I dig a lot. It’s like the lead singer of Tool, but more classic rock. I have no clue if that’s a fair comparison, but that’s where my mind went. In any case, good stuff. I’m glad Deemer recommended it.",
"I saw Evan post about this on Facebook, as it got made into a score follower video. It was only 10 minutes, so I decided to give it a listen. It is written for Violin, Viola, Cello, and Double Bass. It was written for Make Music Chicago 2013, and it centers around exploration of the pitch class G. Evan also states it draws inspiration from rock music, using extended techniques to recreate the sound of an electric guitar with distortion. I admittedly didn’t hear that a ton, but I certainly appreciated the seamless use of extended techniques. It reminds me a lot of Phillip Glass (or maybe even later, totalist composers) in it’s usage of polyrhythmic ideas. Even if these ideas are not happening simultaneously all the time, there are moments where he is constantly switching between syncopations of compound and simple meters. This combined with the sometimes droning, ametrical structure lends itself to a lot of counting. Very ‘On the Will of Tones in this way, which is a piece I am currently working on. Overall I really enjoyed it, and I will certainly reference it if I need extended string technique ideas. Evan knows what’s up, that’s for sure.",
"Pink Floyd’s reputation kinda precedes them, and as such I won’t spend a ton of time researching (because there is just so much out there. They have quite the cult following). In any case, they were a British prog/psychedelic rock group that formed in 1965 by Syd Barret, Nick Mason, Roger Waters, and Richard Wright. Syd led the charge with a lot of their early material, but left the group and the public eye after a falling out with drug abuse and mental health issues. Despite this, they had an incredibly extensive career spanning many generations, if not continuously. They are one of the most successful groups of all time, and The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, and Wish You Were Hear are some of the best selling albums of all time. It is also worth mentioning that David Gilmour joined as lead guitarist in 1967, and Waters took over as head after Syd’s departure in 68’. They are known for their extended compositions, sonic experimentation, philosophical lyrics, and elaborate live shows. They explore themes of disillusionment, oppression, exploitation, alienation, war, and insanity. This album, released in 95’, is their second to last (and fourteenth) album. It was the second album, to be recorded without Waters, being written mostly by Gilmour and Wright. It deals entirely with themes of communication (the title referring to the bell rung in parliament after major decisions), and it is highly ambient/experimental. It received mixed reviews on released, but went on to top charts and become a classic. My initial impressions are mixed. Opening track was My Shit (™), but I really didn’t like What Do You Want From Me. That said, I really really liked Poles Apart. An excellent example of a tune without a chorus, just verses and instrumental solos (like Fields of Gold on the Sting album I just listened to). Definitely very abstract stuff, but I dig it. I must say though, something about the mix isn’t right to me. I can’t quite place it, but everything sounds sorta empty for some reason. Maybe I’m overthinking it, but it doesn’t sound like stuff is really sticking together. It just sorta feels jumbled and tight. I might be used to Frost, but their arrangements maintain a degree of clarity and connectedness whilst being super dense. This feels almost non committed in that sense, where they are going for this super dense sorta sound without fully embracing the depth it needs. Maybe it’s more the lyric tunes, because I feel as though the instrumental tracks come across a bit better. The vocals don’t seem to mesh with everything else going on. Maybe it’s just me, though. I’m just having a hard time getting lost in it, especially because that juxtaposition of avante-garde type rock against a more shallow sound makes it sound… pretentious? Unprofessional? I can’t find the right word, but something about it isn’t sitting amazingly with me. Also, why the fuck is the guitar solo on Marooned panned slightly to the right? I guess you could make an argument that it’s text painting, but my god it doesn’t come across well. It just feels annoying and noncommittal. Really liked the lyrics of A Great Day for Freedom, about liberation and genocide in Yugoslavia. Sorta SOAD vibes here, but also not because he is a rich British dude. I appreciate the sentiment, but I’m cagey to embrace it fully for that reason. Wearing the Inside Out just had a saxophone solo and synth solo thrown in there that felt super out of place. Idk I just really don’t vibe with this album at all. Probably going to stop here, honestly. Maybe I need to listen to it with fresh ears, but I just can’t currently. Probably gonna listen to the Ekstasis concert as a palette cleanse.",
"Just a nice little choral piece by Lili from 1911. Flawless writing.",
"I told John an idea I had for a tune last night, and he suggested I check out this song. I listened to this album this semester, but it admittedly wasn’t a close listen, so I don’t remember much from it other than the fact that they are an indie-folk group, and this is off their second album. If I’m being honest (which I am, because these are my logs), I had a hard time getting into this tune. The lyrics felt a bit to vague for my taste, at least within the context. I’d understand that sort of style in something like Prog Rock, but in a more folk context, I like something more like what Ben Folds does. Maybe I’m not familiar enough with the rep, but the meaning just didn’t really come across all that well without reading interviews and analysis. It’s fine, but not really my thing. This also reminded me a bit of Hozier, but not as heavy sounding. Something about the overall vibe of the group just isn’t really locking with me. At the very least, I guess I know what I sorta want to avoid in writing my lyrics.",
"The second tune John suggested. I’ve admittedly never listened to any Joni Mitchell, but I know she is a massive player in the singer-songwriter world. She is Canadian, born in 1943. She has been cited as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, boasting a plethora of albums (almost all of which she produced herself) and a multitude of Grammy Awards. Her earlier work in the 60’s and 70’s helped define a generation, with her 1971 album Blue considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time. She explored many styles and genres, especially as her voice changed range in the mid-70’s, at which point she began to experiment with jazz styles (working closely/collaborating with many of the big players at the time). Later in life she became a philanthropist, and in 2007, she released her reported final album and dropped from the music industry. She has influenced too many people to list, but some names include Taylor Swift, Harry Styles, David Gilmore, and Haim. This tune is off her third album, Ladies of the Canyon, released in 1970. I also wasn’t a huge fan of this tune, but it’s certainly more in line with what I want to do. This idea of change over time, growing up, is really clear here. I suppose I can’t be too critical of the style, considering that it did come out in the early 70’s. This is certainly the type of thing that was immensely popular at the time, and taken with that context, it makes more sense. My preferences for the early 70’s also revolve around Genesis, which couldn’t be more opposite from this. In any case, I like the verse structure presented here. Each verse shows a different time in an individuals life, and the changed perception that brings. I think my challenge is going to be keeping things concise, while also showing enough meaning. I’ll definitely need to carry imagery through each of the verses, much like what she does here. It gives everything a really clear sense of clarity and meaning. There also isn’t a bridge in this tune, which somehow still works. Sorta like Fields of Gold by Sting. I’m not sure if I necessarily want that, but it’s an option. I should probably listen to one of her albums cover to cover at some point.",
"There’s a lot of other music I could be listening to right now, but I’m in the mood for some Louis Cole. Graham told me to check this one out, so here I am. I listened to his debut album (back when he looked a bit like Mark Zuckerberg), and obviously his 2019 Live album is the go to music for gamer time, but I haven’t heard this one. Graham is also on a huge Louis Cole/Radiohead kick these days, so I want to dive a little deeper. This album was released in 2018 and it is his third. The bandcamp page has some really interesting info on it, including the fact that the album includes collaborations with Brad Mehldau and the Eastman School of Music. All I got to say is this album is incredible, and Louis Cole has soooooooo much sexual energy it hurts. But super solid all the way through. There isn’t a bad tune on the album. After the Load is Blown also sounds unreal with a string arrangement instead of horns. Honestly just so beautiful. And that MEHLDAU SOLO on Real Life is just so hot. Fuck. Louis Cole is my spirit animal sometimes. I need to fuckin smoke whatever he is, becuase he does not give a single fuck, and he does it so well. Trying Not to Die is high key brilliant. The lyrics are freaking hilarious and perfectly relatable, and the metrical rotation during the chorus is super cool. Very reminiscent of I Don’t Wanna Do the Work Today. Maybe it’s no coincidence that these tunes of domestic dread use the same tactic? Possibly, I’d say. Things is unironically a beautiful and inspiring song. Honestly that’s Louis Cole’s whole thing. At face value it all appears ironic, and maybe it is to an extent. But then it hits in a super unironic way, simply because he is such a phenomenal musician. He just does not give a fuck about the way things are supposed to be. Like Jacob Collier, but better.",
"Time for some Punch Brothers, another one of Graham’s favorites. I head the collab album between Thile and Mehldau, but I’ve never listened to just the Punch Brothers. They are an American country-classical chamber music band formed in 2006 by Chris Thile, Gabe Witcher,  Noam Pikelny , Chris Eldridge, and Paul Kowert. Their instrumentation is Mandolin, Fiddle/Violin, Banjo, Guitar, and Bass. They formed on a heartbroken whim, with a desire to explore a wide range of styles with a bluegrass backbone. Thus, it has often been described as prog bluegrass. For sake of clarity, Bluegrass is a style which developed in the Appalachian region of the United States during the 1940’s. It is traditionally played on acoustic stringed instruments, and it derives its style from traditional English, Scottish and Irish ballads and dance tunes, and in traditional African-American blues and jazz. Musically, it is characterized by emphasis of the offbeat and high energy breakdowns where an instrumental solo will improvise around the melody. This album, released in 2018, is their fifth. It was written sequentially, resulting in a clear narrative arc. It won a Grammy for Best Folk Album. Opening track FLOORED ME. God. So good. The sing structure is so unique, the lyrics are unbelievably good, and I just totally dig everything about it. Moreso, it’s about two parents, so there’s a weird connection to what I was literally just working on before this. Second tune has that rotation like I saw in the Cole yesterday. Once again, it is about uncertainty and dread. I think there’s something there. The third tune Three Dots and a Dash has an interesting bit of info about it. During WWII, it was a cocktail consisting of three cherries (dots) and a slice of Pineapple (dash). In morse code, …- represents V, or Victory. In fact, many people also see a connection between this and the opening motif of Beethoven V, leading them to dub it his Victory Symphony. It is likely that the Punch Brothers are aware of this, given their classical background. Jumbo is the best roast of Donald Trump I have ever heard. I love it. The last track made me cry. So much good stuff here, so much meaning and truth. I think this whole album rings tru now in 2021 than it did in 2018, and that’s a testament to the writing. A solid 10/10. Good god.",
"I forgot this album released yesterday, so imma listen. Obviously Steve needs no introduction. This album is about his travels in Europe, and from what I understand, it is a purely acoustic album. I’m very excited. Overall a really cool album. Steve is fantastic on acoustic guitar. I think the album would have benefited a lot from a real orchestra, but that’s forgivable given the current circumstances of our world. Really beautiful music, and a pretty tight mix.",
"Finally, this album gets released! Steven has been feeding us singles for quite some time now, and I’ve really enjoyed every one of them (especially King Ghost). The branding around this album is also exceptional, as it presents itself as a futuristic dynostopia of Capitalism. The music videos all play into this idea of numbers and data, as does much of the language surrounding the release. He even sold one (yes, 1) limited edition release for something like 30k, all of which he donated to charity. It was named something like Ultra Deluxe Music on Obsolete Media, and it contained one track not released anywhere else. Whoever has that is a lucky fellow. Based on what I’ve heard, this album has much more of an electronic pop and funk influence. Based on the singles I’ve heard, it’s sort of in line with Lightbulb Sun, but leaning much more heavily into the pop influence and it’s themes of personal growth in spite of technology. I don’t know why, but Steven Wilson’s pretty tunes always get me so hard, both solo and with PT. King Ghost, 12 Things I Forgot, and Man of the People are just fucked. I also love how he wrote Personal Shopper with Elton John- a man known for his luxurious lifestyle. Like, he takes a section where he just lists various products. So good. I’ve also noticed that quite a few of these tunes have like a Greek Chorus element (in this tune, during the chorus). Kind of a cool idea that I never really considered as an option for songwriting. Honestly, Personal Shopper is an amazing tune. It’s longer form is very reminiscent of something off Anesthetize. I also love during Elton’s interlude, they start layering the personality traits those products represent over top stereoscopically. It builds a ton of momentum that’s super meaningful. Follower is such a cool tune as well. It’s like the sorta punk rock that Cheap Peach writes, but maybe a little less heavy. I’m not too familiar with that genre, so the best I could give is like early 2000’s. The last tune is also gorgeous, The Count of Unease. Sorta reminiscent of Out of Touch, but maybe a bit darker. Rather than raw nostalgic reflection, it is tinged with a bit of self doubt. Overall an incredible album, and an excellent way to end my Fall 2020 listening log.",
"First entry in what is sure to be a very very long semester. This album just dropped a handful of days ago, so I’ve decided to give it a listen. Weezer is an American rock band that came out of LA in 1992. They achieved a stream of mainstream successes in the 90’s with their self titled Blue album, as well as the darker album Pinkerton. They went on a hiatus from 97’ to 2000, returning the following year with another string of successful releases. They are described as alt rock, pop rock, power pop, pop punk, and emo, amongst other labels. They cite artists such as Cheap Trick, the Smashing Pumpkins, and Green Day as influencers. This album is their fourteenth, released during the COVID pandemic. It is a play on the Radiohead album Ok Computer (which I still have to log, because it is an excellent album), and it features a 38 piece orchestra in addition to the core band. It was generally well received. Immediate thoughts, because I have quite a few. This has a vibe, and I wasn’t sure how I felt about it during the first two tunes, but it’s really growing on me. It reminds me a loooooot of Maroon 5, which is probably the pop idiom leaking through, but the orchestra and subject matters also remind me quite a bit of Ben Folds- particularly, So There. Something about the mix is a bit off putting, and I think it’s the compression. It feels a litttttttle heavy handed, especially with a live orchestra. It almost feel like the whole thing doesn’t have enough space to breathe sonically, leading it to sound sort of stifled and trapped. That said, heavier groups like the Smashing Pumpkins do this, and I like it a lot in that context. I don’t hate it here, but it’s definitely bugging me a little bit. A little musical snippet- the tune All My Favorite Things starts with a chorus, which is kinda neat. I also noticed that the percussion in Numbers and Playing My Piano doesn’t drop until partway through the second verse, which has this really cool unexpected sort of sound I think works super duper well. Overall not a bad album at all, but something admittedly just isn’t totally clicking with me. I can’t quite place my finger on what it is, but it’s definitely there. It might honestly be the mix; I really feel like it needs more dynamic space to breathe, especially with an orchestra. I guess that’s something to look out for in my album. I think I need to listen to their first album or Pinkerton at some point, since this seems like the sort of shit I might dig a ton. This album just isn’t quite there, I don’t think.",
"I think Prince suggested I check out this group, but I don’t remember entirely. They are an Indie Pop band that formed out of NYC in 2009. They started largely as a gigging band, but slowly grew in popularity and with various album releases. This album is their second, released in 2011. It received mixed reviews. The music reminds me of stuff by the Replacements in a weird way. I did some digging, and indie pop developed from post punk styles (stuff like Devo and the Talking Heads in the late 70’s/80’s), which in turn grew from Punk Rock of the 70’s (of which the Replacements were a branch- alt rock). It’s interesting to hear how clear this line of development is over the course of many decades. At least, I seem to be able to hear it. The song forms are simple and short, the vocals straddle a line between speaking and singing, and the rhythms are often droning and upbeat. I’ve also noticed that the textures tend to be pretty consistent throughout. Overall I’m lukewarm to it. It wasn’t bad, but nothing really stuck out to me, and it all felt kind of slow. I suppose in many ways that’s the vibe of this style. It would be excellent long car ride on a summer day music, though that might be the David in me speaking.",
"Steven Wilson did an episode of What’s in my bag (linked below, and I couldn’t help but listen to a few of the albums. I picked this suggestion somewhat at random, just because it seemed really out there. They are an English electronic music duo that formed in 1987, gaining quite a bit of popularity in the early to mid 90’s. Their style revolves around electronic instruments and synthesis techniques (including algorithmic stuff), and they blend elements of hip hop and electro funk into their works. They claim influence from quite a few musique concrete composers such as  Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Edgard Varese. This album, their fifteenth, was released without announcement in October of 2020. It was followed by a companion album Signs shortly after. Both were very well received. Overall, this was a super wild album. In many ways it reminds me of some of the Totalist music I’ve heard, but folks like Michael Torke and John Luther Adams. Each tune starts with a specific color or texture, and by the end you are somewhere related yet totally different. My guess is that this is a result of their compositional process, which revolves around them exchanging ideas with gentle modifications like a game of telephone. I think this sort of approach lends itself very well to the colors and sounds at their disposal, as not only can the texture vary, but also the very timbre itself. This isn’t to say that this doesn’t happen in instrumental ensembles like an orchestra, because it certainly does, but I think the difference is more drastic here. Synthesized sounds are much more capable of timbre changes than most instruments. I’m hesitant to say that, since there are a ton of different sounds you can get from an instrument throughout its range or even by using extended techniques, but I think it’s safe to say that the specificity of control on electronic sources is much more nuanced. I’d honestly be super interested to see this ensemble make use of traditional instruments, and through use of digital signal processing techniques in a recorded medium, make something similar to what is presented here. It’s been a while since I’ve listened to any Xennakis or Varese, and I’m not entirely sure if I have listened to any of their electronic works, but I can certainly see the influence. Really cool stuff. Reminds me a bit of Polyphia, but maybe a bit more experimental and abstract.",
"Another album from the Steven Wilson video. My dad definitely listened to these guys back in the day, but I don’t remember anything about them. They are an English pop band that formed in 1981, and they are often associated with the New Wave Synth movement of that time. Their first two albums charted instantly in the UK, and this album, released in 1989, was their last before a temporary breakup. The band was also supposed to play at Live Aid, but due to a scheduling screw up, the backed out and donated money from their subsequent tour to the cause. They are a duo, and they continue to tour to this day. This album was released at a modern day production cost of 3.5 million. It explores styles from jazz to Beatlesesque pop, which is most evident in the tune Sowing the Seeds of Love, on which Phil Collins drums. It was a critical success on release. It was also rereleased in 2020 as a surround sound mix by Steven Wilson, which I imagine works incredibly well. According to what I see on Genius, Phil Collins also played drums on the opening track as well. Wikipedia said they had quite a few drummers on this record, so I suppose it doesn’t matter a ton. This opening track, Woman in Chains is also one of the most 80’s pop things I’ve ever heard. Everything from the gated reverb to the synthesizer parts to the rock anthem-esque lyrics just screams it. I’m also realizing how much the vocals of Peter Gabriel play into this sound (specifically during his solo career). I kinda love it. This group sorta feels like a Supergroup, in the sense that the core (duo) lineup is bolstered by various players from album to album. In this case you see people like Phil Collins on drums (thanks to his success with the intro on In the Air Tonight), and a vocalist like Oleta James. I think she adds a lot to this album, and I might honestly not like it nearly as much if she wasn’t there. Trying to describe the style of this album in my head is super difficult, because it combines so many different musical influences. There are elements of jazz, particularly the quasi-stride style playing and the brief shout choruses. There are also elements of Blues in the vocal riffing and subject matter. There’s also a pop influence in the song structure, which revolves heavily around a pretty clear verse chorus form. At the same time, a lot of the harmonic and melodic shifts (as well as the longer song length) give me a slight prog rock vibe. All of this in the context of a lush 80’s production style- and that’s only the second tune. It’s super unique, and it’s definitely growing on me the more I listen. I’m also realizing just how 80’s a lot of Chicago’s music is. Their lush arrangements/productions coupled with the riffing vocals which often interchange between band members. I might be talking out of my ass here, but I’m really trying to be more detailed with these things. I’ve realized that it isn’t enough to just say it sounds like Chicago without explaining why. Maybe that will be my goal for the listening logs this semester. I’m beginning to realize just how distinct the style and production of 80’s music is. Gated reverb, riffing vocals, lush arrangements, and a generally full sound. Even Prince plays into this sound quite a bit. I think one of the only artists I can think of who doesn’t quite fit the mold is the Talking heads, which makes sense considering that they were sort of an underground act that ended up going mainstream because they weren’t the mold. I’m tempted to go back into my master log and see what other artists I’ve listened to from the 80’s, because I’m racking my brain for other examples. I just did, and I forgot about all of the listening I did for John Seabrook’s The Song Machine. Stuff like New Edition, Boys II Men, The Backstreet Boys, The Police, and even some of Weather Report. It all totally fits. I also notice that there are a lot more songs about political matters. Standing on the Corner of the Third World here, in particular. But you also have stuff like Land of Confusion, Murder by Numbers, et cetera Plenty of stuff like this pre 80’s, but it’s cool to see this stuff hit the mainstream. Famous Last Words is a gorgeous tune. Reminds me a bit of afterglow, in that it’s about love during a nuclear holocaust. I think a lot of this stuff also reminds me a bit of King Crimson, maybe just in terms of the lyrics. Overall I enjoyed this album. It’s a really cool blend of a lot of different styles which I think work rather well together.",
"These guys have been on my list for a while, and I’m in a prog rock mood this Friday afternoon. A Perfect Circle is a supergroup formed by Billy Howerdel (guitarist for Nine Inch Nails) and Tool vocalist Maynard James Keenan. They have gone through many lineup changes since their formation, but Billy and Maynard have stayed constant. The current lineup has Smashing Pumpkins guitarist Jame Iha. The band has many labels, but I like Maynard’s description best: The [A Perfect Circle] music was very different, so I responded differently. The process that we go through in recording with Tool is very organic, but at the same time it is very thought out. There is a very left-brain process of dissecting what were doing and drawing from source material; its very research oriented and esoteric. With A Perfect Circle the process is far more mechanical and computer oriented, but at the same time it is also far more emotional and intuitive. Tool is more a left-brain masculine result, and [A Perfect Circle] is more a right-brain feminine result. This album, released in 2000, was their debut. Each track is dedicated to a person Maynard knows, with the characters on the album cover translating as waterfall of first names. Who would have thought I’d compare a TOOL offshoot to Edward Elgar? In any case, it was a commercial success on release. Overall a good album, but I wasn’t the biggest fan. I’d say it’s like TOOL, but more Alt Rock. I think the thing I like most about TOOL is their more prog elements and the grittiness of the lyrics. The lyrics here are certainly pretty intense (such as a dude unplugging his mom from life support), but I just didn’t feel the same impact from any of it. I’m guessing this is largely due to the absence of those prog elements- namely the asymmetrical grooves. The second half of the album was more appealing to me, as I found the textures and colors explored to be a bit more interesting, but overall it felt kinda dry. Even the production was a little lacking- Blackest Eyes came on directly afterwards, and it sounded like the sound filled the room around me. This was less an issue of amplitude, and rather stereo width and clarity of mix. Granted Porcupine Tree has pretty incredible mixes, but TOOL does as well. So on the whole, I feel a tad underwhelmed by the whole thing. Not bad, but I’d much rather listen to TOOL or just straight Alt Rock (as broad a term as that is).",
"This is a duo ensemble with Matt Kowalski on percussion and a friend of his on guitar. They released this debut EP today, so I’ve decided to check it out. There are two covers on this album, and two originals. I really enjoyed this album. Cool to see more contemporary classical stuff through these timbres.",
"In the interests of staying on top of this, I’m doing a log. I’m kinda stressed about some stuff right now and don’t really want to do anything, but I think I’ll feel better once I start. I don’t remember why, but John recommended I check this one out quite a while ago. They are a Swedish prog metal band that formed in 1989. They are a somewhat elusive group, with not many public appearances dating before their first 4 albums. They have since gone on a few tours, but there aren’t a ton of details out there about them. Haken and John Petrucci claim them as a major influence on their work. This album, released in 1998, is their third. It is a concept album about a ghost returning from the dead to see their family and friends. One detail I saw that’s pretty interesting is that each tune ends with the title of the next. The album was very well received on release. I’m only on the second tune, and initial impressions aren’t amazing. My primary holdup is on the lead vocals, which are incomprehensible yelling. I discussed this matter when I listened to Deaf Heaven, so I won’t rehash too much. I just can’t get into it that much. I get that’s the style, and I think it works in certain contexts, but for an entire concept album, I can’t fuck with it. I may have spoken too soon, because there were just some clean vocals for a second, but not nearly loud enough. I don’t know, I mean- I have trouble picking up lyrics anyways, so maybe it’s less the intelligibility and more just the timbre. I just don’t like it, but maybe it will grow on me. All that said, they are clearly very talented players. Everything sounds super tight and just with it. A productional element I noticed and liked- doubled tracked rhythm guitars panned left and right, but one drops out for a riff played by the other. This creates a negative space on one side that shifts in and out, and I really liked that effect. Back on the vocals, cause my head is still there. I think it’s part of the reason I also can’t get into Mars Volta’s music too much sometimes. Definitely less there, but there are moments where things just get so dense, and then add on the vocals, and it’s just a lot. With a group like TOOL, Maynard’s vocals are so clean. I feel like it really grounds everything. Like I said- I get the point of vocals like these. Maximalized emotional state. Just for me personally, I haven’t gotten into it yet. I guess my biggest struggle with trying to describe why I don’t like this style of singing is that there are parallels in the music which I don’t mind. I mean, look at guitars. How often do you hear a clean guitar tone in music like this? Most times it’s distorted and delayed for a degree of emotional intensity. I don’t mind that at all, even when it starts to interfere with the intelligibility of line. So why vocals? Is it simply because it’s foreign to me? I honestly don’t know. I might try to see what Graham or John think, because they tend to have really interesting perspectives. This is only the third album I’ve listened to since starting these logs (with the other pieces being the Concord Sonatas and the Deaf Heaven). Just don’t like it at all.",
"I think Giggles recommended this group to me. They are a largely instrumental prog rock group which formed out of Dallas, Texas in 2010. They started with a couple viral hits on YouTube, which grew into a fe EP’s and studio albums. They claim influences from many styles and genres. They began as a shred based sound, with later works becoming more melodic. This album is their third and most recent album, released in 2018. All I can say about this album is that it fucking SMACKS. Honestly one of the coolest things I’ve heard in a while. The playing is wicked tight, the grooves hit hard, and the production is incredibly solid. This reminds me a lot of Chon, but with more of an EDM influence. This makes a ton of sense, given that the album features a collaboration with a Chon member on one of the tunes, and production was done by hip-hop and EDM producers Judge and Y2K. Super good stuff that makes me want to dive into groove oriented music. Maybe one of these days (after I get Ableton) I’ll tackle some ideas.",
"I’m not really in the mood to do much of anything today, so I’m going to stick with an unfamiliar album by a very familiar group. I saw a video about this album a few days ago, which discusses the revolution it had on the bands output as well as the music world as a whole. It was release in 1980, and it shifted paradigm of the Talking Heads from Frontman plus group to Band. They spent a lot of time generating ideas through stream of consciousness and long jam sessions, using looping and splicing to pull out their favorite parts and build tunes around those. They were particularly inspired by the polyrhythms of Fela Kuti in his album Afrodisiac. In this sense, and thanks to a lot of Brian Eno’s work, they transformed the recording studio into an instrument rather than a purely hands off object. Additionally, Chris and Tina spent a fair amount of time in the Carribean prior to the albums release, learning many of the local reggae and dub customs from the locals there (including Sly and Robbie, a prolific duo production team associated heavily with reggae and dub styles). The album made use of a Lexicon 224 digital reverb unit, one of the first of it’s kinda and an important step towards the digitization of effects processing. It has been described as new wave, post punk, worldbeat, dance rock, afrofunk, and psychedelic funk. It is considered to be one of the most important albums of all time, and it received massive critical reception on release. I was only half paying attention to the album, but it definitely comes across as super unique anyways. I’m familiar with a few of the tunes, largely due to Stop Making Sense, but the majority was new to me. It definitely has this almost contemplative, minimalist quality owing much to the looping patterns employed throughout. Overall an enjoyable listen.",
"I think Dylan suggested this album to me. The Avalanches is an electronic music group that formed out of Melbourne, Australia in 1997. The group currently consists of Robbie Chater and Tony Di Blasi. They are known for the work in the style of Plunderphonics. This was a term coined by John Oswald in 1985, and it describes a type of sound collage which makes (usually) exclusive use of sampled material- particularly educational films from the 50’s, radio broadcasts, and anything with trained vocal producers. The distinction from this style and other genres which use sampled works (such as hip hop and dub) is sometimes a bit fuzzy, but pure Plunderism is usually defined by an exclusive use of sampled stuff. Obviously this leads to copyright issues, and also explores the boundaries of musical identity and originality. The Avalanches are also described as Sampledelia, which uses technological sampling to expand on the psychedelic movement of the 60’s. This album, released in 2000, is their debut. It combines elements of disco and dance with some 3,500 vinyl samples. They initially weren’t planning on an international release, but after reorganizing the list of samples used and gaining the proper clearances, they pushed it through globally. As such, due to copyright issues, there were a few versions of the album. I’m genuinely interested to hear what this sounds like in even a general sense, as I can’t really imagine how so many samples are going to be made musical. Overall a wicked cool album. It reminds me of the visual parallel, where letters will be made by stitching together clippings from various magazines. You can get a taste of what each sample is, and in some instances where it came from specifically, but the general impression of the whole as something unique is maintained. I should also add that, despite the intense layering of sounds, it didn’t sound too dense. Maybe this is owing a lot to the vinyl sampling techniques they used, but it had less a Wall of Sound feel, and more of the clarity you see with shit like lofi. Not clarity in terms of fidelity, but rather clarity from a textural standpoint. I felt like I could reach in and grab each sample individually, which was really cool. Definitely something I’ll be listening to again.",
"This has been on my list ever since If We Make it Through December and Punisher. It’s been staring me down, but I just haven’t been ready for it. Punisher really hit me, so I wanted to hold off on this until I was in a good mental state. I just got some work done and had a nice practice session, so I’m feeling pretty good right about now. This is her debut album, released in 2017. It’s what helped launch her to meteoric fame, and in the wake of her SNL debut, I can’t think of a better time to dive in. The title is a reference to a line from the show the Big Lebowski. Overall a beautiful album, with some incredibly touching moments. I personally had a hard time connecting with this album than Punisher, but this one also feels overall very specific to some of her experiences. Punisher is too, to an extent, but somehow that one felt a bit more universal. This album also spent a lot of time exploring ideas about death and murder, as well as the loss of innocence and childhood. In that sense, it strangely reminds me of In Absentia, but indie pOpus  This album is very very Phoebe, and I love it for that. I find a lot of her melodic writing and textures to be very self similar, but I don’t have an issue with it. It’s so moody, and the lyrical content is varied enough that I usually don’t even notice it. Everything about her style as a musician is super distinct, and I really appreciate that about the music. I’m definitely a little jealous of her lyric writing, but I also haven’t been in that part of the game for too long. I suppose it comes with time, like anything else. Her stuff is so nostalgic with a tinge of heartbreaking sadness. The lyrics tend to be be pretty straightforward in terms of imagery, but the symbolic threads she nests in there are riveting and gorgeous. Just a great album.",
"Coleman cancelled class this morning, and since I have a bit of time before Smith’s class, I thought I would do some Spectralism listening. We discussed this piece and the composer briefly, but I want to dive in with a little more specificity. Further historical context can be found in the Spectralism resources I have save on my current D: drive. Grisey was a French composer of contemporary classical music. He studied with Messaien, Stockhausen, Ligeti, and Xenakis, among others. He won the Prix de Rome in the early 1970’s, which allowed him to continue study in Rome. It was here that he became friends with Tristan Murail, at which point they formed the group L’Itineraire (later joined by Hughes Dufort). He died in 1998 at the age of 52. He is considered to be a major head of the Spectralism movement, but like many composers, he later rejected the term. In any case, Spectralism is more of a musical philosophy with some general characteristics than a specific school. It seeks to blur the line between psychoacoustics and composition by integrating the acoustical properties of timbre (spectral graphs) into form, harmony, melody, and orchestration. This piece, composed in 1975 as the third movement of his Les Espaces Acoustiques, is an excellent example. It is scored for 18 instruments, and it is an exploration of the low E2 on a trombone. He did a spectral analysis of the timbre, and approximated its overtones to the nearest quarter tone in his orchestration. He also makes use of sum and difference tones to create harmonies. The impression I get is that this piece explores the entire ADSR envelope of the trombone, with the opening chords representing attack, the middle runs section being sustain, and the ending (with all of the whispers and physical gestures) being the release. Super super cool piece. I’m honestly impressed by the amount of content which was able to be pulled from it, and the growth of it was super fascinating to me. Good stuff, and it gave me an idea for a piece.",
"Brett Hobin suggested I check out this album. I’ve admittedly never listened to any Frank Zappa (except Valley Girl and maybe a few other tunes). He was an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, composer, film-maker, and bandleader. His music is characterized by fluidity of form, virtuosity, sound experimentations, and satire of American culture. He had one of the most diverse music careers of his era, integrating elements of rock, jazz, orchestral, pop, and musique concrete. Particularly, he had a fascination with the works of Varese- particularly Ionisation. He was an outspoken critic of organized religion and the American education system, and many consider him to be the godfather of comedy rock. He was a self described practical conservative that wanted less government, lower taxes, and fewer welfare programs. He was also very anti-censorship, which naturally painted him as a controversial figure in the music scene. He had an incredibly prolific output, releasing some 60 albums with his band The Mothers of Invention, and another 50 posthumous records. He is considered to be one of the greatest guitarists of all time, and his influence was immense. This is a live album from 1971, the 12th in Frank’s discography. It is quasi concept, humorously depicting the life on the road for the band. John Lennon and Yoko Ono ended up playing a half hour set on the last day of this concert series, which was released by John Lennon separately. I honestly wasn’t a huge fan of this album. I can respect the playing  and unique style, but it just didn’t do it for me.",
"I really enjoyed the Grisey piece I listened to last week, and since we just touched on this work in class a few days ago, I’ve decided to dive in a bit more. Murail is a French composer (who is still alive!). He studied at the Paris Conservatory with Olivier Messaien, and went on to teach at IRCAM and Columbia University. He was a central figure in the Spectralist movement in the 70’s, and continues to produce works in that vein. In particular, he is known for his use of AM, FM,and RM synthesis as a basis for polyphonic generation. He is a winner of the Prix de Rome, and interestingly enough, he cites the timbre and performance style of Carlos Santana and Eric Clapton as major influences. This piece, composed in 1980, is a defining work in the Spectralist school. Over the course of the work, he shifts from a synthesized bell timbre (inharmonic) to a timbre derived from a trombone (harmonic). This process is meant to be very subtle, which is why he named the work after the supercontinent Gondwana. The bell timbre was created using Frequency Modulation of a single modulator over 5 carriers, interpolated with the first handful of harmonics over those carriers. The trombone timbre was constructed using the Fourier Transform. Overall a wicked cool piece. It has a musical vernacular which is incredibly distinct, both in terms of harmonic content, techniques, and growth. It is very reminiscent of Ligeti and especially the Grisey, which makes sense given its historical context. I’m definitely about to go on a Spectralist kick, given this class, my listening, and even my own work. Good stuff.",
"Sooooooo it has been a while since I last entered (two weeks, at least). Things have been getting a lot busier, and I’ve been struggling a lot to keep up emotionally. That said, I’m beginning to realize that I have a lot of piano work I need to stay on top of (especially for ensemble). So, I thought I’d get cracking at Father Sean’s Top 10 Piano 4-Hands list, which I said I would work through this semester. I won’t go too in depth on Schubert, since there is a lot out there about him and we’ve already discussed him a lot in various history classes, but for my own edification, he was an Austrian composer of the late Classical and Early Romantic Periods. He lived a fairly short life (31), but had a massive and quite influential output. He is perhaps best know for his Lied, of which he wrote over 600. Many were programmatic character pieces, and they often informed his chamber compositions as well. In the world of piano, his last three sonatas are also quite well known. This work was composed in 1828, the last year of his life. It is for two players at one piano, and it considered to be one of his most important compositions. It is in four movements, and it was dedicated to his pupil Caroline Esterházy (a member of the royal family with whom he was in love). The work was published by Anton Diabelli after his death- the same Diabelli who wrote the waltz on which Beethoven wrote his Diabelli Variations. Overall, a total bOpus  I really enjoyed this piece. I’m sorta apprehensive to think about these as actual movements in the traditional sense, given how they move from one to another without break. That said, they are very clearly distinct sections that have really unique characters. In particular, I enjoyed the movement III Allegro Vivace a lot. It’s also worth mentioning that the whole thing is cyclical, as the opening theme makes a few reappearances during the last movement (most notably as a double fugue- wowza). I think the last movement was the highlight for me, owing much to that intense mounting counterpoint that dissolves away into the main theme for the ending. The final cadence also got me pretty good. It ends on a Bbm(6) to Fm cadence, but the way he has it voiced makes it sound very strongly like it wants to got to the V before resolution (probably due to the F and G in the Bbm(6)). I like to think that this particular cadence is a perfect reflection of the unrequited love, as we can see the V chord but cannot quite get to it. There were moments where the Classical nature of this piece shines through, particularly the occasional alberti bass and the over structure of the movements, but the dramatic turns of key, voicings, and textures are much more reminiscent of late Beethoven. I was admittedly very captivated and excited the whole time. I still remember when Beethoven did that for me, and how great of a feeling it was. Maybe I should go back to him sometime, and give it another chance. It’s tough when his stuff has become soooooo overplayed, but there’s no denying that he wrote some very very good music. That said, I really really like this piece. I would put it on the same level as a lot of Beethoven’s stuff, and I certainly have quite the itch to check out more of Schubert’s stuff. I know I’ve heard his sonatas at recitals and rec sems, but I don’t remember them explicitly. Anyways, a really cool piece. I gotta dive back into late classical stuff soon.",
"Another piece on Father Sean’s Top 10 Piano 4 Hands list. There isn’t a ton of info about this one out there, other than that it was written in 1786 and it has three movements. From what I read, this is often seen as being on the cusp of his witty younger style and more elegant mature style. Overall a really cool piece. I’ve never been an avid fan of Mozart, but it’s hard to deny that this kind of music can be really fun to listen to. The interplay between all of the parts was of particular interest- not only between the hands of each pianist, but also across both pianos. I think Mozart’s compositional style plays into this really well, with the clarity of form, line, gesture, and harmony creating a very clear layering of material.",
"I’m not going to have time to listen to this full thing before my lesson, so I am going to try splitting it into two halves. This comes on recommendation from John, as I once more begin songwriting again. Robert is an American singer-songwriter who reached great success in the 1960’s. His music defied pop standards of the time, and by incorporating themes of anti war and civil rights, he became a symbol for the counterculture movement of the time. He moved from Minnesota to NYC in the early 60’s, at which point he was discovered and signed to a management contract. He made appearances at various rallies and protests for civil rights during this time. In the late 70’s he had a mysterious motorcycle accident which kept him out of the public eye for nearly a decade. It is speculated that he crashed on purpose in an attempt to move away from the limelight. In the late 70’s he had a Christian phase of writing, and his writing has been on and off ever since. He continues to write to this day, and he has come to be considered one of the greatest songwriters of all time. This album, released in 1966, was is his seventh. It is considered to be one of the greatest albums of all time, and it is one of the first instances of a double album. Recording was split between New York and Nashville, leading to much confusion over when the actual dates were. It has been rereleased in both stereo and surround sound formats. So far, this is a very strange album. I like it a lot, but there are some things about it which sort of subvert that feeling. For example, Dylan’s voice is pretty terrible. Like, there’s no real way around it. He is not a great singer. The other thing is the mix. It’s a stereo remaster on Spotify, and it just doesn’t sound amazing. The drums are panned all the way to the right for the current tune I’m on, and overall the tonal balance sounds very shallow and bland (like it’s missing a lot of high end). Despite these things, I don’t really find myself caring all that much. Clearly the focus of these tunes is the lyrics and stories they tell, so everything else doesn’t matter quite as much. I discussed this with John a few weeks back (regarding your sound, and how things don’t need to be perfect to be effective). I think that idea really holds true here. The sound is just so distinct, and despite its flaws, they are super easy to overlook in favor of the albums focus- its songwriting. I don’t really know what the focus of my album is, and I don’t think it necessarily matters a ton that I know. I will say that, where it lacks in some areas, I think it makes up for in others. The production is pretty solid for what it is, and the tunes/arrangement are pretty dope. Maybe my voice and lyrics aren’t the best yet, but at the very least, it has a lot of heart. On a more technical note, Dylan’s rhyming pairs are wicked cool. He has this way of rhyming words that are certainly familiar, but maybe not used everyday. For example, Lights flicker from the opposite loft/ In this room the heat pipes just cough. So cool, and definitely something I want to strive for.",
"Another piano 4 hands piece, and I believe the first work by Bizet I’ve listened to since college started. He was a French composer of the Romantic period, best known for his operas and untimely death at the age of 36. His last work, the opera Carmen, was his most successful work by far, as he experienced very few successes before. He died before the work was ever premiered, and thus never saw it become a staple of the repertoire. He founded no schools and had no clear pupils, and many of his manuscripts were lost or sold after his death. It was until the mid 20th century that his work started to gain more recognition. This work was composed in 1871, and it was later orchestrated into a very well known suite for orchestra. These are amongst the only of his piano works to enter standard repertoire, as his other works are considered far to difficult for the average player (Bizet himself was a talented pianist, though he rarely appeared in public). The suite consists of twelve short movements. Overall a wicked cool suite. It’s sort of hard to qualify in the way I usually do, as a combination of other composers, because it’s so all over the place/ In many ways it reminds me of Ravel’s Le Tombeau de Couperin with it’s quasi-Baroque dance form and distinct textures. In other ways it also gives me strange Mussorgsky vibes (I mean, it’s basically a French version of Pictures at an Exhibition). I’m also getting inklings of Poulenc with it’s playful nature (even though he didn’t come onto the stage until a bit later), and even further of a stretch, I hear some Mozart. Definitely mystifying, and very fun. The slow movements felt like they dragged on a bit, but his skill with more upbeat stuff is very apparent. This work makes me want to give a crack at piano four hands writing. Maybe over the summer…",
"It’s Tony’s birthday today, so I thought I’d give one of his solo albums a shot. This is his frist, released in 1979. Genesis had just been coming out of their Gabriel period, and many see this album as his take on that period. It received poor reviews on release, but modern perceptions are much more favorable. Tony Banks did all of the keys work, Chester Thompson played drums, and Kim Beacon (a lesser known artist who passed in 2001) did vocals. I didn’t have a chance to listen to this album all the way through due to other commitments, but I got about halfway through and am finishing the second half on and off today. All I have to say is, WOW. This album is MY SHIT. It’s like Elton John had a child with mid-period Genesis. It really tickles all of the right things for me musically. The form and meters are pretty straight forward, but the colors and harmonies that Tony Banks waves into the tunes is so sublime. I mean, even the very first chord of the entire album is just awesome. I think it’s roughly D Lydian Dominant, but I’m not totally sure. In either case, this album seems right up the alley of what I’m writing these days. So good, might be my favorite album I’ve heard so far this year. At the very least, it is well up there. Definitely a hidden gem, I think. It does not have a ton of listens on Spotify, which is super surprising to me. I def gotta listen to more stuff by Tony Banks. He is the keyboardist of my favorite band, after all.",
"I just went back through, and surprisingly, I haven’t listened to any Xenakis since I started college. The only times he was mentioned in my logs was as the teacher of Alexander Desplante and an influence for Autechre. So, this is a wonderful opportunity to dig a little bit. He was a Greek-French Composer of the 21st century. He was originally from Greece, but illegally immigrated to Paris as a refugee from the Greco-Italian War in 1947. This was not before tank shrapnel seriously wounded him, blinding his left eye. Since he was fighting for the left wing cause, he was sentenced to death in absentia by the right wing administration. This wasn’t lifted for many decades later in 1974, after the fall of the Greek junta. The guilt over leaving his country became a source of inspiration for much of his music. He had graduated college with a degree in Civil Engineering, and was able to get a post at an architectural firm in Paris. While in Paris, he studied with Arthur Honneger (and thereby many of Les Six), as well as Olivier Messaien in an attempt to pick up composition. He quickly became renowned for his work. He is known for his pioneering usage of mathematical and statistical models in the context of his music. This piece was premiered in 1957 for large string orchestra, two trombones, xylophone, and wood block. It translates as actions through probability, and it is inspired by the statistical mechanics of gasses. It has been a long while since any chemistry/physics course, but my basic understanding is that he uses the Gaussian distribution of molecular motion in gases to model temperature. So although the motion of molecules in a given medium is random, it follows a probabilistic pattern which correlates to the temperature. He models these physical interactions through varied pitch and rhythmic content throughout the ensemble. Overall a really wild piece. I haven’t looked at a graphic score in a while, and this one was particularly interesting in how it was able to literally portray the colors and textures of each Section (used loosely because Spectralism). It begs the question of formal construction, in terms of process. I think he worked around a set of metrics creatively, but I could sorta see this also being purely derived content. I also have many questions about performance approach, so hopefully I will get to see it live someday. There were certain textures that worked really well for me, but at time, it felt a little blocky for something which is so continuous in nature. Those areas weren’t bad per se, but I found the more dense textures with shadows of gesture to be more personally effective. Overall really cool stuff.",
"Since the piece I had on my listening list for Dufourt seems to have slipped through the cracks, I figured this listening journal for Dr. Smith would be the perfect opportunity to make up for it. He is a French composer associated heavily with Spectralism (having coined the term himself). He studied piano and composition at the Geneva Conservatory, was a founding member of Ensemble lItinéraire, and also helped establish CRISS (Instrumental and Sound Synthesis Research Collective). His best known work, Saturne, was composed for the institute. Many of his larger scale works draw inspiration from writing and paintings. This piece was written in 2014 to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the percussion ensemble Percussions de Strasbourg. It draws its title from the William Blake poem the Tyger. It is scored for six percussionists, and is written in twelve movements. Like the poem, the piece focuses on the juxtaposition of opposite forces as a means by which to truly represent the real world. As stated by the ensemble, Yet, from the abyss of misery, mankind can perceive the rise of a burning light, which indicates, without any promise, a possible alternative to the savage rule of force. I’m hesitant to just say This piece was a slow burner since most Spectralist pieces tend to be, but I found it to be especially true in this instance. I didn’t dislike it by any means, but I was kinda ready for something new to happen by the fourth or fifth movement. The colors and shifting masses were very interesting, but I personally felt as though an hour of them was too much. I feel as though this piece might have functioned better on a much smaller scale. Again, not terrible by any means, but it definitely wore on my ears after a while.",
"John told me to listen to this album, because it reminds him a lot of my music. In particular, he wants me to pay attention to the percussion writing. I haven’t listened to the Beach Boys before, and given their significance and the significance of this album, this is gonna be a long entry. That said, they were an American rock group out of California in the 60’s. They were composed of three brothers, a cousin, and a close friend. Their music was defined by their vocal harmonies, eclectic styles, experimentalism, adolescent themes, and innovative recording techniques. There’s honestly too much info to list about them, so I’ll include highlights. They were integral to defining the California surfer sound. They experienced a ton of success after their 66’ album Pet Sounds, but their popularity feel off soon after. They continue to make music to this day, with their last album released in 2012.  Their early success with the surf rock phase was overshadowed by the British Invasion, at which point they adapted their musical style to more closely align with the mainstream. They often cite Rubber Sole as a key influence for this album, and this album served as immense inspiration for the Beatles. In fact, Paul described it as their main impetus for writing Sgt. Pepper’s. Due to their influence and innovation, they are often cited as one of the most influential groups of all time. This album was composed with the express purpose of creating a continuous experience with no filler tracks. It is their 11th album, and it is considered to be one of the most progressive pop albums ever made. Musicologists consider it to be a very early example of a concept album which advanced the field of music production with non standard harmonies, timbres, and production elements. It cannot be reproduced live, and it is one of the first times that a popular group departed from small ensemble formats. The album helped to legitimize pop music in the public eye. Brian states that it is less a thematic concept album, and more a production concept album- an interpretation of Spector’s Wall of Sound. Due to its ambiguous key centers and immense production, it is often considered to be within the vein of psychedelic rock. The final was mixed in Mono, as Wilson was partially deaf in one ear and preferred music that way as a result. Production costs totalled around a today half a million, which was unheard of at the time. The album had lukewarm reception on release. I’m gonna listen to the stereo remaster, because I definitely prefer stereo shit on the whole. I’ll listen to the mono someday though, since it was so important to Wilson. Overall a pretty cool album. It definitely as radical as I was expecting, but that’s wicked easy to say in 2021. Taken through the context of its time, it’s definitely huge. The ideas John had about the percussion are super clear- there’s a sense of coloration over motion, at least in terms of the percussion. Momentum is generated elsewhere in the music, with percussion serving to aspect structural and coloration changes. I can definitely hear how the Beatles were influenced by this for Sgt. Peppers. I don’t think I like it as much, but it’s still super solid.",
"This album comes recommended to me from Katelyn, who referred to is as The most emo album she listens to regularly. They are a dream pop duo that formed out of Baltimore Maryland in 2004. Dream pop is a subgenre of alternative rock and neo-psychadelia that is characterized for its breathy vocals, use of guitar effects, dense productions, and preoccupation with sonic texture and atmosphere as much as melody. It has a lot of overlap with Shoegaze, and the terms have come to be synonymous in many circles. Phil Spector’s Wall of Sound productions are a dominating factor, and Brian Wilson of the bEach Boys also explored the genre extensively. It was formed by  vocalist and keyboardist Victoria Legrand (who also plays organ) and guitarist, keyboardist, and backup vocalist Alex Scally. Their debut EP was recorded over 4 days on a four track, and it was released to immense success. They have since release 7 albums, and have garnered quite the following. This album is their second, and it was release in 2008. The album reflects themes of dreaming for a better life, and it was released to mostly positive reviews. Only on the first tune, but I’m already kinda getting George Harrison vibes. Like, George mixed with Pink Floyd elements. Maybe even Neo-Baroque, with the harpsichord and sixteenth note syncopated patterns. That might make a bit of sense, depending on Victoria’s organ playing background. Overall a really cool album. It has a density about it while also being incredible transparent; immense, yet small. It’s like halfway between Flatsound and Noble Oak.",
"We now jump from the French Spectralist school to that of the Romanians. He is perhaps the best known Romanian Spectralist composer, alongside composer Horațiu Rădulescu. Much of his output consists of acoustic works, though he also incorporates electronics as well. Much of his music revolves around his interest in philosophy, particularly applying the principles of  phenomenology (the nature of experience and consciousness) to music. Unlike many composers, he accepts the Spectralist label while distinguishing himself from the more serial French Spectralists. There isn’t much info on this work out there, other than that it was released as part of a compilation album in either 2001 or 2005. Overall a really wild piece, unlike a lot of the stuff I’ve heard before. The closest parallel I can draw is maybe something by Geroge Crumb, but run through a computer. At least in terms of texture- this work lacks a lot of the traditional elements we might consider to be melodic. I personally felt as though I could hear specific signal transformations, as it relates to instrumentation. For example, the whole opening seemed to be structured around manipulated timpani and double bass recordings. This slowly grew into extended string techniques (manipulated), before falling back down registrally. Really interesting piece, which despite being 15 minutes long didn’t really feel so.",
"Fritsch was a German composer often associated with Spectralism. He began playing violin at a young age, and went to various schools in Germany to study music and philosophy. He considers his first real composition to be from his 21st year, which had somewhat of a succès de scandale on first performance. Despite this, he continued writing for various ensembles and electronics. He is one of the founding members of the Feedback Studio of Cologne, and he took on many students before his death is 2010. There is very little information about this piece available, other than that it was composed in 1984. Overall a really cool piece, and possibly one of my favorite in this vein that I’ve heard so far. I feel as though this work is maybe a bit further from some of the earlier Spectralist works that we’ve listened to, or at least, different from the French Spectralists. I think of a work like Partiels by Grisey especially, and the difference is very clear. The influence of Spectral Analysis in that work is much much more evident than in this work. Granted, Partiels represents a direct derivation of a very specific facet of acoustic physics, but even still, this work feels distinct in many regards. For example, I feel as though it is much more melodic than most of the things we have listened to so far. I don’t necessarily mean meloody in terms of a regular form/arc, but the prime material is a line as opposed to a color. I also feel as though the growth of the piece is maybe more staggered than a lot of other Spectralist works. Fritsch seems to be composing with these blocks of sound, and while that is a component of many Spectralist works, his transitions feel much more akin to Neo Romanticism or Neo Classicism than a continuously Spectralist development. Many of these points might just be my subjective stance, yet I still find myself enjoying this piece quite a bit. The ending was maybe a bit lackluster, but otherwise a very cool listen.",
"Now onto the American Spectralists playlist, which features quite a few names I recognize. In this case, I seem to recall us reading a few articles by Fineberg for the first half of this class (Rep and Analysis, for the sake of confused future me). He was born in 69’ in Boston. He completed his undergrad at the Peabody Conservatory, before moving on to graduate studies at Columbia University. This was not before he moved to Paris to study with Tristan Murail for a time. He has since joined the faculty at the Boston University School of Music, as well as collaborating with IRCAM composers and many others. He has also worked with computer programmers to develop tools for digital composition, as well as perceptual research. He served as the US Editor for the Contemporary Music Review for six years in the early 2000’s. This work is off his 2018 album Sonic Fictions, which features a handful of his newest works. This work, composed in 2016, is scored for a trio of Bass Clarinet, Bassoon and Cello soloists complemented by an on-stage ensemble of Flute, Oboe, Piano, Percussion, Violin and a trio of French Horn, Viola and Double Bass in the rear of the hall. The program notes state that he wanted to blur the division between pitch and noise, creating a kaleidoscopic effect much like a hall of mirrors. This is another really really cool piece. I don’t think the kaleidoscope effects is immediately apparent, but I certainly do get this sense of… rotation? It’s kind of hard to put into words, but the whole piece does feel as though it has this tumbling sort of quality, where timbres and techniques cascade over one another in this continuously shifting conglomerate of sound. So maybe, on second thought, the Kaleidoscope effect is apparent. It’s a piece like this that really gets my gears turning, especially when it comes to content generation. Usually I can have some idea about where people are deriving material from. Even in more complex instances, such as Pithroprakta, I can at least garner a basic understanding of how material was generated (at least on a conceptual level). With a piece like this, however, where the growth and overall sound is so unpredictable, it’s hard to imagine an underlying system. There certainly could be, but I can just as easily imagine a work such as this being completely built around through-composition in the purest sense. In either case, it’s a wicked cool piece. I feel as though the continuous growth and development of sound is more apparent here than in Fristch’s String Quintet, and I suspect at least a part of that might be owed to Fineberg’s time studying with Murail. I definitely want to listen to this whole album at some point.",
"Ok I knowwwwwww I’m supposed to be exposing myself to new music here, but I simply cannot turn down the opportunity to listen to more Fagerlund. His Bassoon Concerto blew my freaking mind, and I am sooooooo thrilled to see more of his works on this playlist for Post-Spectralists. This is compounded by the fact that I forgot to mention in my previous entry (the Fineberg) just how much some of the textures remind me of Fagerlund’s writing. I’ve already covered Fagerlund’s short bio in my entry on Mana, so I won’t type it all out again in the interests of time. This work was commissioned by the Finnish Broadcasting Company in 2013, and it continues Fagerlund’s series of concertos (in addition to Mana, he also has a violin and clarinet concerto). The work is divided into six sections, which, according to Fagerlund, feature an organic growth and interaction between the ensemble and guitar soloist. He also stated that this work was a challenge for him, since the guitar is quite a bit more delicate than his other concerto instruments in regards to intensity of projection. As he put it, Clearing the space for the soloist is really precise and demanding in the guitar concerto. While the expression here is quieter than usual in my works, that doesn’t mean the music couldn’t be intense. Overall a really cool piece. Much of what I had to say about Mana holds true here, especially in regards to how well the soloist and ensemble work together. I never get this sense of hierarchy during the work, as the whole thing feels so unified and organic. In many ways, I feel as though this was basically just Mana for guitar. The textures were necessarily lighter as a result, but overall, the writing is very characteristic. In many ways this is a good thing, as I love Mana, but at the same time, I think it is also the piece’s primary downfall. I almost wish the writing had been more different, to exemplify the fact that this isn’t Mana. Maybe a petty criticism, especially because I don’t have an issue with composers sticking to a style (it’s their music after all), but I personally would have liked to see some more variation. There were times that the colors were so similar to Mana that I had trouble hearing it as an independent work. Even some of the motifs and gestures he used sounded like they were almost exact cuts from the former, and while I don’t necessarily dislike the idea of this large scale cyclic unity through his concertos, I definitely would have liked to hear something a bit more distinct. In any case, not a bad piece by any means. It’s certainly something I would suggest to other listeners. But for me personally, I’d much rather just listen to Mana.",
"Ended up getting super busy the last few weeks, so I’m going to just do rough entries of what I’ve been listening to lately. Luke recommended me this one, and it’s really really cool. Unlike a lot of the other stuff he has sent me, but in a really good way.",
"Listened to this whole album while doing 110 down Interstate 90, and it was an incredibly surreal experience. It’s like ambient electronica, with a bit of that Dave Fridman flair often seen in albums he produces. Thick, floating, gorgeous. An incredible album.",
"Some Ben Folds while he was in the Ben Folds Five. This was released in 1997, and it’s really cool to hear him in this context. A bit more youthful, but still maintaining his characteristic whitty style. This is going to be the perfect summer driving album, exactly like Rockin’ the Suburbs was last year.",
"Another album recommendation from Luke. This one was really wild, and definitely pretty far outside of my comfort zone. I suppose I would describe it as punk rock, maybe post-hardcore (without doing any reading on it, and trusting my very limited listening in this genre). It’s almost like Lou Reed and the replacements, but with more of an edge. The vocals cusp on the border of yelling, and the production is overall just very dry. I’d absolutely love to work on music like this sometimes, since they are all super characteristic instruments that are very exposed production-wise. I tend towards more wet mixes, and I’d really need to find a middle ground here. In any case, a cool album. It took some time to grow on me, but I definitely like it a lot. It was also released the same year as the Ben Folds Five album above (1997), so that’s a neat parallel.",
"Fuck. That’s all I have to say.",
"Here we go, summer 2021. Even though it’s already been here for like three weeks. Shows how slow I’ve been with listening, and I really want to change that. Especially with so much free time in between work at Arlington, I gotta spread out my time investment more evenly (instead of working on a single album for 9 months). So, I’ve been meaning to check these guys out for a while. They are an American Alternative Rock Group that was formed by John Flansburgh and John Linnell in 1982. Initially the two performed as a duo with a drum machine, but later expanded to include a backing band. They are known for their experimental, absurdist lyrics and unconventional instruments/techniques. They found great success on college radio, as well as in children’s songs. They’ve done a ton of stuff in their career, but one thing which stuck out to me was their Dial a Song project. This was in place through the 1980’s and up until 1998, and it consisted of their music recorded to an answering machine. They would advertise the phone number in local newspapers, allowing people to call in and hear a live performance. Wicked fucking cool idea. This album, released in 1992, is their fourth. It is named after the cancelled Apollo mission and coincided with the international space year, of which NASA dubbed them the official musical ambassadors. This was their last album as a pure duo, and they opted to strive for a more fleshed out rock sound than previous albums. This led many fans to boycott their shows. The album also contains the Fingertips suite, a series of 21 short tracks meant to be dispersed throughout the album byu the shuffle mode on modern CD players. It received mixed to positive reviews by critics on release. A really wild album, I enjoyed it immensely. It’s proof that really anything can work as lyrics, if done properly. Another style I’d love to strive for.",
"I guess it’s time to finally check these guys out. They are an English rock band which formed in 2002. They are often credited as one of the first bands to gain popularity primarily through an internet platform, revolutionizing musical branding and marketing in the process. They are often described as indie rock or garage rock, with many other stylistic elements appearing throughout their discography. This album, released in 2009, is their third. It represents a departure from their more punk sound, leading instead into Californian Desert/Surf rock. It received pretty middle of the road reviews across the board. Overall I agree. There were a few tunes that got me pretty excited, but for the most part I was kinda uninterested. Felt like my date with Katelyn last month, only I’m the album. I can’t help but hear some Gazpacho in there, minus the prog elements.",
"Got this in the mail yesterday, adn between my car and Spotify, I’ve listened to almost all of it. A really intriguing album (a word I never use, so you know I’m serious). Especially after working on my album for so long, which is very progressive wall of sound type stuff, this was jarring in a refreshing sort of way. I kept expecting the songs to move towards some fully fleshed out moment, like something in a Ben Folds tune, but it never happened. This in an of itself was climactic, as you are forced to focus on the incredible musicianship of Thile. The moments may not be fleshed out, but they are certainly climactic in their own right. The fact that he can accomplish with just his own voice and a mandolin is a true testament to his dedication to the craft. This may not be an album to listen while driving with the windows down, but it has a mellow excitement to it like nothing else. Really good stuff. Worth noting the first track, where they used a foot stomp to fill in that lower frequency band for a bit. Might be useful to screw around with if I ever do a solo album with someone (cough cough).",
"I was just gonna read and go to sleep after this long ass day, but I kinda want to check out a bit of this album before I do. It was released today, and I really enjoyed both singles off it. Looking now though, I see that it’s a double album, so I doubt I’ll get through all of it. I just want to listen for the next hour or so, form some impressions, and then finish it off tomorrow. So far, this album is really wild. I wasn’t sure if it would diverge away from the sound of Happy and Sorry, and it really hasn’t. It’s like Mars Volta, but New Wave 80’s. The album feels like chewing broken glass that tastes like bubblegum. Between the dark and crunchy vocal effects, the string orchestra, rock band underpinning, electronic elements, and existential lyrics, it’s really in it’s own little niche of sound. It’s so Danny Elfman, but in it’s own super unique way. One thing in particular that I like a lot is the tendency to employ brusque stereo bouncing effects, particularly in the strings and vocals. It heightens the sense of space in a really intense way. That and the intense DSP on many traditional instruments, leading to a sound that’s borderline alien and unrecognizable. I heard this in the guitars quite a bit, which were so heavily modified that they sounded more like weird synth-guitar hybrids. Overall, I feel as though this album rides that cusp of intelligibility. At least stylistically, it borders being comical in it’s sound without quite getting there (for the most part). Instances like Happy are certainly a hyperbole, but other tunes definitely feel to walk that line in a really neat way. I feel like that’s a big part of the reason that this album falls so perfectly into the uncanny valley- conscious anxiety personified. I have a hard time falling in love with this album, simply because I don’t think that’s the point. It is a Big Mess, after all. Side note- Graham showed me a Battle song called Fort Greene Park in response to this album, and we went into a massive discussion about…. Stuff. Like, why the tune feels so emotionless and austere. Basically, the weird sounds undermine the emotion of Punk grooves and stylings. Then maybe that’s the point? To show the death of emotional artistry at the hands of technology/production/AI or something. I could kinda see it, but Idk if the execution or concept were strong enough. In either case, the Elfman holds up better for me. It doesn’t feel like a novelty, at least not all the time. It establishes a consistent tone from the get go, develops it, and executes it well. I suppose much of it falls down to precedence.",
"Graham told me to check this one out, after I asked him for out there albums. I’m going to give it a quick listen before I get ready for work. Stauber is an American singer-songwriter and YouTube personality from Pennsylvania. I’ve only seen a few of his videos, but I recall them being pretty wild. He’s done a few projects for Adult Swim, but he is best known for his work on the YouTube platform. This album is his third, released in 2017. It experiments with pop, lo fi, and 80’s/90’s aesthetics. The first two tracks went viral on TikTok, and have since gained a massive number of streams globally. In addition to his hypnagogic pop (music meant to evoke nostalgia for times past), he also creates distinctive animations to accompany his works. Overall a really really great album. The tone it established right from the get go was very strong, and I think the work as a whole fed off that nicely. The hypnagogic aspects of it really got to me. I felt myself drifting away, often times thinking about Clara, or other times about my dad and Drive 35. I suppose those things make sense. Bothersome and Candy Eyes were by far my favorites, although the lyrics of My Plea were a close contender. Reminded me a ton of more laid back Louis Cole tunes, mixed with Beach House. I really good combo, I need to explore more stuff from this genre for sure.",
"John is on his shit. I think these are the strongest tunes of his that I have heard.",
"I know I should be striving for more diverse music, but I’ve been very sad lately, and I love Ben Folds, so I’m gonna reward myself for dealing with what I have been. This is their most recent studio album, released in 2012. I don’t think I explored their bio much on the last album, so a few key points. The formed in 1993 in NC. They are actually a trio, opting for the name because it just sounds better than the Ben Folds Three. Robert Sledge and and Darren Jesse are the other two members (and I seem to recall the former being referenced on Rockin somewhere. Maybe on Not the Same). Either way, kinda cool. Folds described their music as Punk Rock for Sissies, which I absolutely love. The disbanded amicably in 2001, but came back together for this album. Highlights so far: Draw a Crowd, Sky High, and The Sound of the Life of the Mind. Really interesting lyric writing here. Maybe a bit less straightforward than his earlier stuff? But still pretty on the nose in terms of what is being said. I guess more adventurous is the way I’d describe it. At least, it has a lot more edge. It’s like Whatever and Ever, but less optimistic and much grittier. I don’t even know if I’d describe that album is optimistic in the first place, but it definitely feels a bit more light hearted on the whole. This album feels less Early 20’s Angst and more Wow having a career and being an adult is tough. Gonna finish the last three tunes later, but overall, I like it. Not as string as the other album in my opinion, but it definitely has a unique sound that’s still very Ben Foldsy",
"Brett mentioned these guys in passing a few weeks ago, so I decided I’d give them a listen. They are an alt rock band from Sacremento CA that formed in 1991. There have been a few lineup changes, but Vince DiFiore (Trumpet) and John McCrea (vocals) still remain. They are known for their sarcastic and deadpan lyrics, prominent trumpet lines, counterpoint, and wide range of stylistic influences (everything from mariachi to Iranian Folk Music). This album, released in 2001, is their fourth. It was generally well received, though many critics noted it’s similarity to their prior work. Overall, I freakin loved this album. It’s very reminiscent of They Might Be Giants, but with a sense of balance/coherence I felt Apollo 18 lacked. I’m not sure if that is a qualitative observation or if it’s totally subjective, but I definitely liked this album a lot more. The range of influences was certainly cheeky, but not in a way that doesn’t work. It’s still very clear that these musicians are incredibly skilled not only at performing, but also seamlessly integrating a range of influences in a way which still comes across as coherent and unique. I particularly enjoyed variety present throughout the album as a result, all whilst it still fit into a cake sort of sound. Probably a messy description of how I feel, but it’s the best I can do. In general, I also noticed similarities to my own writing (in terms of the counterpoint). I’ve found that I tend towards layered voices as a way of filling out a texture, and they seem to move in the same sorts of directions. The only real difference is that the timbres they use are quite a bit more distinct, whereas I tend to have just Synths. Overall really really good stuff.",
"Listened to a bit of these guys as well after hearing them on farmer’s boat playlist a few weeks ago. They are a Canadian rock band that formed in 1997. They are often described as post-grunge, which is a marriage of the grunge aesthetic with a less abrasive tone. It arose in the late 90’s with other bands such as Foo Fighters and Nickleback. They have released six studio albums, all at three year intervals, to pretty widespread success. This album, their fourth, was released in 2012 as a rough coincidence with the actual transit of Venus across the sun. It was their attempt to break away from the mold in favor of experimentation with new instruments and electronic instruments. Overall, I must admit that I really wasn’t a huge fan of this album. Maybe it’s my association with the style in cheesy motocross videogames from the early 2000’s that I played as a kid, but it has this proposed edge that feels almost artificial. I personally attribute that to the Post-Grunge aesthetic as a whole. It seems to me a contradiction to undermine the abrasive edge of grunge, which is the cornerstone of the sound in the first place. It almost has this pop-y, rock anthem sorta sound. I associate this with a more mainstream sort of thing which, once again, goes against a lot of the central tenets of grunge. This isn’t to be that hipster, saying It can’t work. This album doesn’t not work- there are a few tunes a like quite a bit (in particular, the second tune Chalk Outline). But with that said, I personally don’t find the contrast of an attempt at a more mainstream sound with a grunge influence to be that appealing. It feels a bit like stylistically pulling back your punches, in a sense. It isn’t bad, and a loooooooot of people like it, but I probably won’t be listening to a ton of it.",
"Stepping back a bit, I went to Alice in Chains. I’d always heard a lot about them, but never listened to much. They are a grunge group from Washington state which formed in 1987. Grunge formed as a synthesis of Punk and Heavy Metal, but without a lot of punk’s structure. It’s primary genesis was the Pacific Northwestern US, particularly Seattle. AIC came to lead this charge in the early 90’s along with bands such as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Nirvana. They are known for their integration of heavy metal elements into their sound, as well as the distinct vocals (often harmonized) of lead vocalist Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell. Many of the band’s members suffered from substance abuse, which is frequently reflected in the lyrical content and themes of their music. This album, released in 1992, is their second. It takes on a markedly darker tone from their first album Facelift, as many of the band members sought to confront their demons through music. It is their best selling album to date, and is often listed as one of the greatest albums of the 90’s. Overall, I liked this album much more than the Three Days Grace. Maybe it isn’t a perfectly fair comparison, but for the sake of stylistic development, I am tracing it anyways. The edge of this album feels much purer and more sincere than the Transit of Venus. I think much of this is owed to the delivery of the vocals, the structure of the tunes (which feels much more open ended and unpredictable at face value, a bit like the Mars Volta), and the general avoidance of these commercialized Moments. I don’t know if I could objectively point to these things, but I certainly feel them. The music feels much more dynamic in it’s growth and depictions than the post-grunge stuff, and I like that a lot about it. It leans into it’s sound, and it works. The only criticism I might offer is very similar to my reservations of the Mars Volta- homogeneity of sound. With a group like Cake, or maybe more closely the Pumpkins, every tune feels super distinct in character. I think a part of this is due to the fact that the themes which are explored are maybe a bit more diverse than what unfolds in this album, which is largely just a catharsis of struggle. Similar to the Volta, which depicts a story which is continuously raging. There are great moments, and this isn’t a terrible thing, but it wears on my ears after a while. The tune Rooster was a nice reprise, for example. It had a more laid back feel, a bit more expansive its sound. If the album had more of that, I would be much more on board with it. That said, an overall pretty great work. I’m excited to explore this vein of style a bit more.",
"Decided to try something new last week. I get very caught up in listening to individual albums very meticulously. It can be great, but it’s super time consuming, and maybe not quite as effective at showing large scale developments. So I met up with Votra, and we explored to evolution of punk roughly chronologically. We picked key albums in the style, and listened to a few tunes off each in quick succession. It was a really fun way to sorta hear how the style evolved, and at least hit some of the major players. I’ll list each individual album, along with some thoughts for each below.",
"The seminal punk rock album from 1976. It featured very short and simple song forms (mostly verse refrain, all largely the same). Three chords for almost everything. Lyrics blurred the line betweens singing and yelling, and there were many moments which were just yelled. Distorted guitars, anti-establishment lyrics (but not vulgar). The Blitzkrieg Bop is probably the most famous on the album.",
"This was just a year later, and over in the UK instead of the states. I guess that this was a pretty direct development from the Ramones, but I haven’t researched it yet. Very very similar sound. Super simple song structure, harmonies, arrangements, vocal delivery. God Save the Queen and Anarchy in the UK are super famous, anti-establishment tunes.",
"This was a 1979 album. The arrangement is a little bit more thought out, dense, planned. The harmonic language also expands a bit. Instead of just I IV V, we get the occasional vi and even some bII action in the opening track London Calling. The production is also markedly better, less DIY sounding to my ears.",
"This is a 1975 album, and part of the Riot Grrrl movement. This was an underground feminist movement that combined elements of punk rock with politics. It was big in the early 1990’s, but many argue it stretches back to albums like this. The whole album isn’t punk in my opinion, but the seventh track Horses definitely has the same sort of structure and aesthetic as the other groups above.",
"Another member of the Riot Grrrl movement, this album a simple collection of hits. Scanning through, it is very easy to hear the similarity to the Patti Smith tune and early punk rock in general. We also get some vulgarity finally. In many ways, it sounds like the B52’s. From what Votra told me, a lot of that New Wave stuff from the 80’s found it’s roots directly in Punk Rock of the 70’s. So, I’ll also likely hear a lot of Talking Heads in this stuff.",
"Moving away from Riot Grrrl for sec, we get this album from 1979. It often listed as one of the greatest punk albums of all time, and one of the best albums of the 70’s. The band is listed as post punk, but to my ears, this album is solidly on the tail end of the original punk. It is probably more aligned with the Clash in it’s planned arrangements, more adventurous harmonic language and such. That said, the vocal delivery is very similar to that of the Ramones. I also notice some interesting rhythmic/metric stuff going on too. I really enjoy this one so far, and I have to give it a full through listen. Oh, they are British. Important to mention that.",
"1981, we get what is considered by many to be the first hardcore punk band. Vocals like the Ramones, but far far heavier. The production is super DIY, mixed down a ton. To me they really do sound like the Ramones, but run through a stylistic distortion chain. Really really cool.",
"This 1985 album makes me chuckle simply because it’s such a fucking Votra detour. It’s kiiiiindaaaaaa punk? But really, it’s just Irish sea chanties with some edge. We have accordion and pan whistle, so like, you tell me. Super fun to listen to, in any case.",
"Another 1985 album, this one very very similar to the Black Flag album. It sorta reminds me of Deaf Heaven’s Sunbather. I wasn’t a huge fan of that one simply because the vocals were totally totally inaudible. I get a similar feeling from this one. To me, it really is cusping on the border of noise vs. music.",
"Probably one of the most important albums of all time. At least, I’ve seen it literally everywhere. We hit 1991, and with it the beginnings of Grunge. Another branch of punk, but losing the simple structures and intense speed. It’s like Black Flag, but, for lack of a better term, more thoughtful and introspective. I like this one a lot based on what I’ve heard, and I definitely need to give it a full listen through. Votra also told me to check out their album In Utero for some more experimental stuff.",
"We jump a few years ahead to 1994, and get Green Day’s third album. They are a super popular group, leaning much more into pop punk than grunge. In fact, the album is often credited with bringing punk rock into the mainstream due to it’s success. Based on my quick listen through of some of the tunes, it definitely has the speed and structure of punk from the mid 70’s. That said, the vocal delivery is very much so in the vein of popular music (longer form melodies, clean timbre, vocal harmonies throughout). For me this kinda ruins it, but that’s just personal preference. It doesn’t not work, but it definitely has a sorta bubblegum sound compared to the other albums I’ve listened to so far. It gives me beach tower vibes, but much faster and leaning less into the surf rock feel.",
"We jump forward a year to 1995 and get one of Votra’s favorites, led by Gwen Stefani. This album didn’t really do it a ton for me. It sounds like it’s halfway between Cake and Green Day, especially with the non-standard instrument choices. It isn’t terrible, but there was never a moment where I got super excited about what I was hearing. That said, it was pretty refreshing to hear a female vocalist. This is much less punk and more solidly third-wave ska (which is often seen as another offshoot of punk).",
"Here we get more pop punk, this album being released in 1999. Funnily enough, the same producer (Jerry Finn) did this album as Dookie. It was enormously successful, largely because the whole concept behind production was to make punk more accessible to the masses. The cover artwork famously features pornstar Janine Lindemulder clad in a nurses outfit, and themes of the album focus on adolescent heartbreak, suburban parties, and maturity. Once again, something about it doesn’t really work for me. It’s odd, because you could make the same argument about Ben Folds Five in regards to making punk more accessible. The difference in my mind is that the BFF made something entirely unique, not only in regards to content but also in terms of instrumentation (and subsequently, style). This is just punk, but 12 years old.",
"Skipped this one, which came out in 1998. I’ve listened to this album quite a bit, and I really like it. It’s def in a pop punk vein, but leaning more punk. They also do a lot of sorta prog things, at least to my ears. Noise elements, sudden shifts in texture to break up the form, and even non-musical elements like radio introductions. It’s pretty hip. To round off the session, Votra gave me a bunch of ska suggestions. I didn’t listen to any of these, but I want to put them down anyways. Save Ferris, Reel Big Fish, Mighty Mighty Bosstones, Squirrel Nut Zippers.",
"A collaboration EP from Cheap Peach and Wether Channel, a band that’s apparently from Syracuse. Overall a really strong album that aligns nicely with my punk rock listening. Idk exactly what I would describe this as, maybe pop post-punk. In any case it works really well. The guitar riffs especially draw a ton of interest. Good good shit. I will probably listen to this on the regular.",
"Happened to find this album in a Goodwill like three days after my party with Votra, and I’ve been listening to it a ton in my car. It’s their fifth album, released in 1997. The group itself formed in 1983, and is considered to be pivotal in the creation of ska-punk as part of the third-wave ska movement. The album features the hit The Impression That I Get, though my favorite track is the eponymous one. It’s considered to be one of the most important ska-punk albums of all time, in spite of criticisms of it’s flat production. I tend to agree with the production criticism, but it’s hard to not love the album anyways. It’s really like Chicago, if it was less Boomer and way way more fun. It’s really the first ska album I’ve ever listened to, so I don’t have a ton to compare it to, but it definitely makes me want to check out more. That, and apparently a Japanese Ska Orchestra played the closing of the Olympics (which, according to Costanza, signifies the fourth wave of ska). In any case, good shit.",
"Recorded entirely on cellphones. A great vibe all around.",
"I read a really interesting article yesterday about the Whitewashing of Prince. It discusses how Prince’s role as a cultural bridge artist often led to white audiences disregarding his black identity. They tend to prefer his 80’s work and his fictional biracial label, as it more easily fits their cultural understanding. The Prince that emerged in the 90’s more fully embraced this identity not only in terms of theme, but also in the genres of music he utilized. That said, many of the issues affecting black communities were an integral part of his even earlier works- it was just often overlooked by innocent (thanks Dr. Smith) white listeners. It’s less likely that his 90’s sound was trying to push away those listeners, but rather encourage them to listen and learn from his music in a way that they maybe haven’t before. For me (a white listener), this is a fascinating concept. When I think Prince, I think the electric stage presence, the sexual and spiritual themes, and the general embrace of the 80’s sound. I don’t usually tend to think of him as a social activist, at least not for the black community, and I think a lot of that is just a result of the type of music by him that people generally get exposed to. I pulled up this 2001 album because it is mentioned in the article, and I’m astounded to see that not a single track has over 1 million listens. The album explores concepts of spirituality, human sexuality, and racism through the fictitious story of a social movement toward a Martin Luther King Jr.-inspired utopian society. The sound is far more organic than his previous albums, drawing on the live feel of the jazz tradition. And honestly, I’m at a loss for words on this one. EASILY in my top 10 albums list. Like, fuck. It’s just so good. A massively beautiful and impactful concept album like nothing I’ve ever seen. It has the same sort of feel as A Love Supreme, but Prince instead of John Coltrane. The idea of fighting oppression through unity is perfectly captured through this quasi-Biblical tale, as if Supper’s Ready was applied through a social justice lens. I think She Loves Me 4 Me is one of my new favorite love songs, Everywhere just absolutely fucking smacks, and the last track Last December is like Dialouges Part I&II by Chicago on crack (which I mean in the nicest, most unnoffensive way possible). I genuinely think that this album is the anthem of a generation, and I am so incredibly surprised that it isn’t more well known. An absolutely incredible piece of art.",
"Possibly my last fall listening log as a college student. Weird. Seriously have no idea where all the time went (except for those two stupid Covid years from home). In any case, thought I’d start out with this album. I really liked Nirvana, but I was told this tune is more experimental (and I usually dig shit like that). This was their third and final album, released in 1993 (a year before Kurt Cobain’s suicide by shotgun). I read his suicide note, and it was pretty sad. He seemed to express a lot of guilt over not finding enjoyment in his music anymore, or in the adoration of fans. Apparently some his ashes are in Ithaca. In any case, this album was a conscious divergence from there prior more polished album (Nevermind). There was a bit of drama around it’s release, regarding fan speculations of record company interference due to commercial viability. Despite this, it released to critical acclaim. First track, Serve the Servants is about divorce. I really like the subtle panning of the vocals back and forth. It’s just enough to make you uncomfortable. The second track is inspired by the book Perfume, which follows an orphan with an exceptional sense of smell through his career as a perfume tester and eventually a killer. The tune uses very interesting distorted yelling and guitar gestures, reminiscent of more metal noise components. This was also evident in the last track. Rape Me is a really neat tune about a victim accpeting their fate, knowing that the perpetrator will rot in prison under the same fate. Controversial, but Cobain’s way of supporting women against violence, or possibly his rape by the media at the time. Really REALLY cool panning stuff happening here, where one channel will be almost entirely blank at times. I think this album reminds me of a more hardcore punk sound than Grunge, but it isn’t quite solidly in either of those categories. I also read a bit about the mixing disputes with producer Steve Albini. Cobnain felt as though the vocals and bass were weak in the mix, but Albini refused to remix. Their mastering engineer (Bob Ludwig) addressed some of those issues, but Cobain still wasn’t totally satisfied. Even before reading that I felt as though the bass was a little weak (kinda hollow and boomy). In fact, I even double checked my Sonarworks settings a few times. I feel like it needs more subbass and high end, with some transient shaping to add punch. It’s simultaneously overwhelming and underwhelming. I might be interested to run it through Tonal Balance Control and see where it’s stacking up. The last lyric of the album All in All is All we are, is really really cool and fitting. Especially because the tune is called All Apologies, which resonates with his suicide note a ton. Apparently there’s also a hidden track on Non-American pressings of this album called Gallons of Rubbing Alcohol Flow Through the Strip which is mostly about Cobain’s heroin addiction. Overall, this is a pretty neat album. I like it mostly because of it’s contrast against Nevermind, both stylistically and thematically. I think Cobain definitely had a lot of negative feelings towards the media, his fans, and himself that he wanted to get out. Really wild.",
"Wow, two in one day. Free time is so nice. I think I saw this album on Prog, and it seemed kinda cool. This seems to be a collaborative group (sort of a supergroup, but maybe less…. super?). This album was released in 2019, and it’s their debut. Overall a pretty cool album. It felt like equal parts Radiohead, Lonely Robot, and Beach House. The production is super solid, right along the lines of what I generally tend to like. Dense, full, yet clear. Definitely would listen to this one again. It’s an album that feels like it wants to be listened to, but in a really quiet way. I definitely dig it. The last track is so pretty, almost like Gazpacho in it’s growth (generally very slow, but in a meditative sort of way).",
"We all know Kanye, but I’ve never actually listened to any of his music. He apparently started out as a fairly influential producer at Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000’s, but soon became intent on pursuing a career as a solo artist. He has released quite a few albums, each to critical success. He is known for drastically shifting styles and complex compositional techniques/productions. This album is his 5th, released in 2010. He went into self exile in Hawaii after some legal troubles, and recorded this as a communal project. There were many contributing musicians, including appearances by Bon Iver, Rihanna, Elton John, Jon Legend, Kid Cudi, Niki Minaj, and more. The album was a joint release from Roc-A-Fella and Def Jam recordings, and it is heavily inspired by Maximalist aesthetics. It is often cited as one of the greatest albums of the 2010’s. The themes largely focus on Kanye’s status as a celebrity, as well as various social and political issues. The production process rivaled that of the Smashing Pumpkins. Kanye rented out all three rooms of the studio for 24 hours everyday, bouncing from room to room when he hit a creative rut. He never slept, only took 90 minute powered naps, and hired to private chefs for hot and cold food. The album was incredibly well received, though it did have a polarizing effect on his audience, and some say it weakened his role in the mainstream. Also, the incident that led to his exile was when he took the microphone from Taylor Swift at the MTV VMAs and tried to defend Beyonce. So far really really fucking good. The lyrics are dense, but in a good way. The tune Gorgeous reminds me a lot of To Pimp a Butterfly, which is maybe an obvious or easy comparison. It was really really cool to hear a King Crimson sample in POWER, especially when one considers that Kanye really is a 21st Century Schizoid Man. Apparently the original vocalist and bassist liked the tune so much that he would play it at the start of his solo shows. The freakin outro of Runaway. The thick, Jay-Z sound of Monster. There’s so so much in this album, as there often is with Hip Hop albums. I’ll never fully understand it. Really cool album.",
"Decided I want to more thoroughly explore this catalog, at least in my free time. This is their first album, released in 1991. It had an unusually large budget and scope for an independent band, and it was well received. The Rolling Stones ranked it as one of the greatest Grunge albums of all time. Overall pretty great. The hits are obviously the hits, but there’s a fe other tracks that also hit pretty hard.",
"We analyzed a little Rolling Stones this morning in Pop Analysis, and like an hour later, I found out that their drummer Charlie Watts passed away. This album choice feels appropriate. It’s their tenth American album (eigth British), released in 1969. It marks a return to their earlier, more blues influenced sound. The band’s original founder Brian Jones became unreliable due to drug use, and was fired halfway through recording. It was very very well received on release. A pretty straight ahead album that sits really well. Midnight Rambler was like a blues opera, which is definitely not something I necessarily associate with the Stones. Pretty decent stuff.",
"One of Graham’s favorite groups, and I’m looking for something completely new right now. They were a high school band from California that formed in 1991, but later expanded slightly and had some staff turnover. They fall pretty solidly in the alternative rock/alternative metal scene of the 90’s, but they are also sometimes seen as having nu metal elements (a subgenre of heavy metal that combines elements of hip hop, funk, and electronics). This album, their third, was released in 1999. It launched them into the mainstream, becoming their best selling album to date. It represents a departure from their earlier sound, opting instead for a more mainstream appeal. They worked with mixing engineer Scott Litt, who also worked with REM and Nirvana. Honestly not a huge fan of this one. I’m only two tracks in, but the vibe is not for me. I feel like I’m playing an ATV on gamecube, slamming capri suns, and saying fuck for the first time. The lyric writing and vocal delivery is so cheesy to my ears, at times almost reminiscent of Ben Folds (which is an easy comparison, but whatever. That’s my default for accessible lyrics with a common vernacular delivery). For Ben it works, because he leans into that sound. It defines his music. Here though, it’s metal minus all the things that make metal cool. Kinda like the post-punk shit of Three Days Grace. For me, metal is great because of its edge and grit. This feels like Metal for Middle Schoolers. I talked to Graham about it, and he says I should switch over to Morning View. So, I’m gonna do that.",
"This is their next album, released in 2001. I was wrong, because this album is their best seller. Overall, I liked this album much much better. It was more subdued and thoughtful, which fit the style of writing a ton better.",
"Ross played me a track from this last night and it was pretty cool, so I think I’m going to listen while I’m hanging at the laundromat. Not quite as cool as Sundays in UC, but I’ll make do! I’m honestly surprised that I’ve never heard of her before, but better late than never. She is a singer, rapper, and actress hailing from a working class family in Kansas. She started performing young, released some music during her college career, and slowly grew in popularity. She has currently been nominated for eight Grammys, and won an MTV award. She also starred in the movie Hidden Figures, as well as some other TV and film appearances. It seems as though there wasn’t ever really a breakthrough moment for her, but more a gradual climb up the ladder. Pretty cool. This album, released to universal critical acclaim in 2018, is her third studio album. It was recorded in between major film roles, with release being delayed a few times. Prince apparently had a big hand in the album up until his death in 2016. It is markedly less psychedelic than her prior albums, opting instead for a more funk/R&B/neo soul/ pop influence. Overall a really cool album. I can definitely hear a ton of influences in there, and the production was really really solid.",
"I’ve definitely heard of this dude before, but I don’t remember where. I know he is a NYC based composer that works a lot with jazz/soul/rock/funk/Indian music fusion. Not a ton of info otherwise, but this album was released in 2017. Overall a really cool album. Reminiscent of Tigran Hamasayan, or maybe even shit by Go Go Penguin (but a bit less so on the latter). The sudden shifts in contrast worked really well for me. I also thought the production was super solid. It leans more into a rock sort of mix than jazz, but given the style, I think it works really well.",
"Saw a weird ass post about this album on Facebook yesterday, and decided to dig in. Craig Smith was a part of the 60’s folk music movement in the United States. He got a little too into the Hippy Movement of the 70’s, however, and literally went insane. I read that he went on a trip with some friends to Kabul in Afghanistan. He parted ways with his friends before reaching there, and basically disappeared. The friends heard rumors that he had gone crazy, and threatened to kill some people in a market with a knife. It is then rumored that he went to an insane asylum for some time. This was after his rising interest in Transcendental Meditation, and his association with the Manson Family. He returned to the states in the late 60’s before travelling to South America. His life beyond that point is characterized by a deteriorating mental status, outbursts of violence, prison time, and eventually his death in 2016 living on the streets. These two albums (released as a double alum only very recently) were two works he recorded in the early 70’s, during a time in which he thought he was the Messiah. They are incredibly rare, with only a few copies in existence. From what I understand, someone got ahold of them and put them up on Spotify. I have no idea what to expect. Honestly a pretty strange album. Like, it’s kinda straight ahead 60’s folk for the most part- very reminiscent of the Beatles. But a lot of the production and even songwriting choices are a little off kilt. Like, distorted vocals with intense panning, ambient talking sounds/nonsense. I usually don’t expect that sort of thing from this time period, or at least not in this stylistic context. It sounds more like something King Crimson or Genesis would do, and even that is pushing it a bit. The use of those elements in this stylistic (and historical) context is definitely very cool. I wouldn’t say I like the album, but it’s definitely a really cool piece of history.",
"I don’t remember why, but Coleman told me to listen to this piece. He’s an American composer, Co-Founder of Bang on a Can All Stars, and the husband of fellow composer Julia Wolfe. He studied at Yale, and had a lot of experience with the underground scene of NYC in the 80’s, I’d guess. He’s currently on the faculty of the University of Southern California. This piece was written in 2004, and funnily enough, it was his response to 9/11 (which is tomorrow). It’s for amplified Cello and electronic playback. An accompanying film was later made by Bill Morrison. Idk if I’m just like, primed to be emotional cause I’m sick, but this hit hard. Like, I started crying on multiple occasions, and it’s only like 7 minutes long. It was so simple- the fixed media track being very reminiscent of bells, textural pads which I think were derived from cello chords. The solo part was also very very simple, essentially just playing perfect intervals, sequencing by 7ths. But the performance and everything about it came together into something truly haunting. The growth was so linear, and at times hard to perceive. Very minimalist in that sense. But the moments of climax, usually marked by a slight shift in the texture of the electronic track and range of the cello, were super impactful. The ending especially- it sounded like nondescript voices entered the track, and in that moment, the cello started to glissando. From then on, everything fell apart. It sounded just like airplanes falling from the sky. Absolutely incredible- and so very well timed. I definitely think Coleman suggested this so I could see how subtly the texture shifts, as well as how many of those shifts are signaled by some sort of marker (like glissandos; how very fitting). Really really good stuff I could learn a lot from.",
"I don’t remember who exactly suggested this one to me, but I think it was Alex Everett. He’s a guitarist and singer from Australia. He has been listed as one of the greatest prog rock guitarists of all time, gaining significant praise from Steve Vai in particular. This EP was released in 2016. Overall a really cool album. I thought the density of the production, in terms of tonal balance and stereo imagining choices, was really really strong. Like, exactly what I like about a lot of my favorite groups. It was a little much to take in at times, which might be largely due to it’s purely instrumental/soloistic content. In those senses, it reminds me a ton of Polyphia, Chon, and even some of Dream Theater’s stuff. Not necessarily a bad thing, but not my favorite in the world. I can see why Alex likes it so much, since I know he is a huge Polyphia fan.",
"Currently working on a piece for clarinet and piano, and Graham/ Jeremy both said it reminds them of this piece they played on Jeremy’s recital. He was a Polish-American composer/pianist that taught at the University of Arizona until his retirement in the late 80’s. He died in 2010. This piece was composed in 1973. I can see why this may remind them of my music. Pretty simple melodicism, and very short movements.I’m not sure how much can carry over given the instrumentation difference, but I definitely think I can do more in the way of having more conversation between the piano and clarinet, as well as making sure that my key moments are signaled a bit better.",
"I just revisited Agon, and Coleman also told me to check this one out. It was written in 1964, and it was his last major orchestral composition.  It is named such due it’s dedication to Stravinsky’s friend Aldous Huxley, who died the same day that JFK was assassinated. There are many debates regarding the form and number of variations, especially since there is no distinct theme beyond the twelve tone row it uses. The central feature of the work is a twelve part invention. Overall a pretty wild piece. I feel as though it lacks a lot of the direction that Agon has, but the focus is more heavy on the texture and density. Stravinsky’s orchestrational skills lend the piece an incredibly uniform sound, in the sense that no one part ever felt out of place or scored poorly. Listening to it felt like drinking honey. Reminds me a bit of Koechlin.",
"I listened to a few albums this week. Here and there, not super in depth, but I want to log them anyways. This one we listened to a bit in Root’s class, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It was released in 1971, and it contains quite a few of her biggest hits. I think I may have listened to it already to be honest, but I’m too lazy to go back and look right now. Just really solid songwriting that is very pleasing to listen to.",
"I know I know, I’m a bad fan cause I’ve never really listened past Wind and Wuthering. But since I’m literally seeing them in a little over a month, I decided I should explore a little further. This is the 4th album after W&W, released in 1983. It was preceded by ACABA and Duke. So, pretty deep into their Phil Collins period stuff. It was their most popular album at the time of release. While it certainly isn’t their Gabriel period prog, I did enjoy the album a lot. The sound is very proto-80’s pop rock, but in a good way. There wasn’t anything on the album that was unconvincing, and it felt very cohesive. I’ll definitely be listening to it casually.",
"On a similar note, I also listened to Steve’s latest album. His last album was cool, but this one leans much more into his prog rock roots. I was hesitant about the album, especially after the music video for Wingbeats (which was absolutely fucking terrible). That said, I think they led with a weak tune, because the rest of the album is pretty strong. The guitar work is good, the songwriting is pretty ok, and it manages to mostly set a pretty convincing atmosphere. I’m using a lot of neutral language because I didn’t listen to it a ton, and I wasn’t completely sold by what I heard. Not bad though.",
"I listened to this on a whim, but it ended up being pretty timely, as her father’s conservatorship just got dropped like, two days ago. Anyways, I listened to the single off this a while ago, and decided to poke around the album a bit. It smacks. Its so cheesy 90’s pop (it was released in 1999), but I don’t see that as a negative. I kinda like the cheesy sound and production quite a bit. It’s very very clear, but also pretty fun. I could definitely learn a lot from how backup vocals are mixed- so punchy and full, without overwhelming the lead. Super good stuff.",
"It’s time to dive into these guys, cause I’ve never listened to their stuff before. They are an American rock band that formed in Seattle in 1994. It was founded by Dave Grohl, former drummer for Nirvana, after Kurt Kobain’s suicide. It initially started as a one man project, but others soon joined. He wanted to do what no one expected, which was play drums in another band. So he started as guitarist for his own group. They are often described as alt rock, post grunge, and hard rock. They are an enormously successful group. This album, released in 1997, is their second. Gabe and Eric said I should start here. It is their most popular album. Overall, a bangin album. Reminds me a bit of the Smashing Pumpkins, but leaning more towards a Nirvana kinda sound. It takes the edge of their music and combines it with a lot of the contrast you see in the SP. A pretty common trope in the 90’s, but I think it comes across super well here. Might be a new favorite.",
"I listened to this album this morning in a stupor- tough time sleeping. I didn’t do any research on it, other than that it was released in 1992. Since I might be meeting Mike this week, I kind of want to know less about it. That said, I really really like this one. It’s further proof of how great the 90’s were- it’s so utterly different from any other kind of rock I’ve heard from the decade. It’s subdued, slower, darker. Definitely want to listen to more by them.",
"A recommendation from Olivia. They are an experimental pop band that formed out of Baltimore in 2003. They integrate elements of noise rock, psychedelia, and freak folk (a subgenre of psychedelic folk characterized by acoustic sounds and pastoral lyrics). There are four members, and albums released under the bands name may include contributions from all or some of them. This album, released in 2007, is their seventh. Despite being their first album to chart, it is also notable for the 6 song which leaked prior to its release. I wasn’t listening super closely to this one, since  was filling out contracts for Ethos, but I feel kinda lukewarm to it. A lot of the noise elements were integrated in a really seamless and interesting way, but it didn’t totally hit for me. I’m not entirely sure why, but there was never a moments where I was taken aback. I think maybe it just felt to saturated with those ideas, and there wasn’t enough contrast to let them sink in. That might not be entirely accurate either though, because I would say Frost is the same way sometimes, and I still really enjoy their stuff. I might just have to think about it some more. It had really intense Ok Go vibes, mixed with maybe Aphex Twin. Not bad by any means, but maybe not my thing. I’ll keep listening here and there this week.",
"Mike Redmond brought one of the tunes from this album to class today, and it kinda blew my mind. Super harmonically creative, so I’ve decided to check out the full thing. They are a husband and wife duo which formed in 2004. Not a ton of info on them out there, other than that they exist and have a few albums out and about. Not a horribly well known group. This album is there second, and it was released in 2010. I’m honestly pretty lukewarm to the album, at least from a production stance. The whole thing felt a little too washed out for my taste. Groups like Beach Tower or Frost do a great job with productional density, especially when it comes to maintaining clarity and using it as an effect. Here, it felt less like an effect and more like a mistake. There oftentimes wasn’t a really good sense of depth in terms of foreground or background, or one element would be placed randomly way way too far forward. It sounded like there were a ton of really cool arrangement elements in there, and I wish I had an easier time hearing them. Otherwise, the album was pretty cool. It reminds me a bit of Fiona Apple or St. Vincent, but more prog. Nightingale is def the highlight of the whole thing for me. Maybe I will change my mind with a few more listens. Like, there’s a lot of music that has this sort of sound (especially in prog and punk scenes), but I’m not totally sure it fits here. I’ll see if it grows on me.",
"First single in 12 freaking years. Very very cool. It’s like Lightbulb Sun crossed with The Future Bites. Very excited for the full album next summer.",
"CSO played this a couple nights ago and it was pretty wild. The second movement in particular got me. A double fugue, with what sounded like eighth note canon. It passed down through the strings to create this delayed wash of sound, over which a second fugue theme was laid in the brass. I listened to his piece And God Created the Whales a couple years ago, and didn’t like it a ton. Funnily enough though, I did mention wanting to check out this piece eventually. Cool how things can come full circle.",
"I saw someone mention the album Juice on Facebook, and I was really intrigued b the cover art. It’s not on Spotify, so I thought I’d dive into another album. Ryo was a Japanese guitarist known for his work on synthesizers and in the jazz fusion genre. He spent much of the 60’s in Japan performing with various jazz ensembles. He moved to New York City in the 1970’s, where he dug heavily into jazz fusion. During the 80’s he spent more time developing digital music instruments and software, such as the Kawasaki Synthesizer for the Commodore 64. He returned to jazz fusion in the 90’s, and continued releasing music until his death in April of 2020. I hadn’t really heard of him before now, but it seems he was a pretty influential character behind the scenes. He was very heavily involved with NYC loft scene of Jazz (folks like Gil Evans), and his work on synthesized instruments and programs had long lasting impacts on the field. Not much info on this album. Most places say it was released in 2019, but wikipedia says it was released in 1980. I suspect it’s a rerelease since there isn’t much of his music on streaming at all. This was one of his first albums to use his guitar synthesizer (any system which allows guitarists to access synthesizer capabilities such as Midi, multi effects, and DSP). Overall a really cool album. I got really heavy 70’s prog vibes, crossed with a dash of Steely Dan (who were also exploring a similar kind of thing in their stuff). Definitely an album I will be listening to again soon.",
"A new album from this guy. Kind of lukewarm to it. It’s cool, but definitely a little homogenous at times",
"Shit knocks, idk what else to say about it. The lyrics are the perfect amount of absurd and sincere for me, the textures and timbres are super fun and interesting, and the album never feels like it’s stagnating. Really really good work here. It definitely makes me excited to work with Bucket on some stuff.",
"Watched this movie the other night, and thought the OST was pretty cool. I haven’t heard a horror soundtrack that was so noise/synth heavy in a while, and it was really cool. Might be an oversight on my end, but I enjoyed listening nonetheless. Very effective, and the artist has quite a few other albums out that I want to listen to sometime.",
"Ray played one of the tunes off this for me in the studio last night, and it got me very excited. He’s a Bri’ish lad (Robin Skinner), only a couple years older than myself. He got his start with single releases on YouTube and Bandcamp, slowly amassing followers of his indie pop/bedroom pop  sound. He currently has 4 studio albums, along with quite a few EPs and singles. This is his third album, released in 2018. Overall a pretty cool album. I thought the first half was stronger than the second, but I also started spacing out after the first few tunes. Green was the resounding highlight for me. A nice mix of Phoebe Bridgers, but with less density.",
"Dr. Root showed us this in class last week, and I’ve been listening to it a lot the last few days of Thanksgiving break. It’s just so good. Ultravox was a British New Wave band that saw quite a bit of popularity and success in the 1980’s. Like many New Wave bands, they were known for their use of synthesizers in addition to other more expected elements of the time. In this way, they very intentionally distinguished themselves from the Punk Rock scene which had take hold in the UK during the mid 70’s. This album, their fourth, was released in 1980, and it is by far their most successful. I absolutely love this album. The use of synthesizers feels so seamless and not forced at all. Not that I’ve ever heard this before, but I find with a lot of breakthrough works, things can be a tad heavy handed/ not sit well. Not at all the case here. The titular track is utterly incredible. I think the final climax is easily one of the most well balanced chords I have ever heard. Brilliant stuff, I definitely want to dig in a little deeper at some point.",
"I only listened to this album in very brief passing, as I started writing my own shoegaze tune. I really now it is maybe more ambient synth pop, or maybe a synth art song, since pure shoegaze tends to be much more focused on guitars. But whatever, close enough. They were an Irish-American band that only released three albums (this is their second, 1991). It’s considered a breakthrough work in the genre. I really enjoyed the density of the whole thing. I’ve come to find that I really really enjoy feeling enveloped by the music I listen to. Maybe it’s a sensory thing. In any case, it floats in a really unique way. It has the drive of punk/grunge, but the quasi-noise elements lend itself to a different sound. It almost feels like being in a vacuum sometimes. Thanks parallel compression. I definitely want to devote more time to listening to it.",
"MY BOY BRINKERSCHNOOT. He did all the recording and production on this one, and it turned out really well. I’ve heard snippets here and there, but it’s really amazing to finally hear the whole thing. Wire is definitely my favorite track. The timpani makes me think of Fiona Apple, but even edgier. Very riot Gurrrl type stuff. Very proud of him.",
"Jesus. So unbelievable. Genesis, Punch Brothers, a dash of Frost. Might be one of my new all time favorite albums, unironically. Uncle Jack and Winchester Hill are highlights for me. A Boy in Darkness is also an utterly fascinating tune, with little hints of Anthracite Fields all throughout. David was a truly talented guy, absolutely tragic that he’s gone. Apparently he auditioned for Genesis after Peter left, which is not at all surprising. It made the Genesis concert on Saturday so much more unreal than it already was. I’ve had this album on loop, and I haven’t gotten bored yet. Great great stuff. Oh, 2012 release. That’s pretty important.",
"Another little stroll into synth pop, as I start to think about future projects. This is a debut album by the Norwegian pop band, released in 1985, and it was enormously enormously successful. Like, I don’t know of another debut album that did so well. I only listened through once, so I want to dig a little deeper into it before I make any crazy suggestions, but initial impressions were really good. The synth tones they got are incredible, and mesh with the rest of the ensemble (especially vocals) really well. Between this and Vienna, I might be finding a new favorite genre. In November 2012, all three bandmates were appointed Knights of the 1st Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav for their contribution to Norwegian music. Take that Elton John.",
"Catching up a little tonight, since it’s break and no one is around to gamer. I bought this at the soundgarden, just to check it out. It’s a little too balls to the wall for my taste, but my god can we all learn a thing or two about synth sounds from it. Like, the timbres are just SO good. Not only in terms of how they function individually, but also in terms of how they compliment each other in the arrangement. The growth is also pretty cool too, as it’s very slow but methodical (music to be danced to). Some really interesting metrical modulation stuff in there that I liked as well. Good stuff.",
"Another Cake album, this one from soundgarden as well. Aka, I’ve been listening in my car. Also really fucking good. Comfort Eagle blew off my socks for a while, and while this didn’t exactly do the same, it still has some really really great writing and arranging in it. They know their sound super well, and I like them for it. Hearing this album next to Cakewalk by Karrot Kake also makes me chuckle. So similar, in so many ways!",
"Now, time for some NEW NEW music (because- it’s been a while). The meme album really grabbed all my focus. But these fellas just released this to bandcamp last week, and as of today it’s on streaming services. Ryan sounded pretty proud of it, and I know that Olivia did some string arranging on it. Also, Jenna did everything else. So I gotta check it out. I’m gonna put it on while I work on a project for Dr. Avni. Good stuff overall. I think this album has a much moodier and mature sound than their first album. Unexpected, but it shows they have some flexibility in what they put out. That’s really exciting. I hope to see more from them in the future."
